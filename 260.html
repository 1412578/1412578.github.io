<p id="L1">The main harbor, where the fishing boats of the fishermen fill the sea and the boats come and go rapidly.<br><sup>漁師たちの漁船が海上を埋め尽くし、船の出入りが激しいメインの港。</sup><br><sup>Fishermen's fishing boats filled the sea, making it the main port of entry and exit.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">From there, a small boat came towards me on the shore of the forest facing the sea where I was standing.<br><sup>そこから少しズレて、俺が立っている海に面した森の岸辺に、小さなボートが一艘こちらに向かってきた。</sup><br><sup>A little out of the way, on the shore of the forest facing the sea where I stood, a little boat came towards me.</sup></p>
<p id="L3"><br></p>
<p id="L4"><br></p>
<p id="L5">"That's it.<br><sup>「アレだな」</sup><br><sup>"That's not it,"</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">"Mm.<br><sup>『うむ』</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L8"><br></p>
<p id="L9">"I thought it was a smuggler's ship, so I thought they were using a big ship to transport it. ......<br><sup>「密輸船っていうから大型の船で運んでいると思っていたんだけどな……」</sup><br><sup>"I thought you were carrying it on a large ship because it was a smuggling ship..."</sup></p>
<p id="L10"><br></p>
<p id="L11">"I guess that's how it was until the middle of the trip. But normally, large ships are allowed to dock at ports, and their cargo is checked when they unload. They must have reloaded a smaller ship on the way to the port to carry the illegal goods secretly.<br><sup>『途中まではそうだったのだろう。しかし、通常だと大型船は港の停泊の許可だったり、荷下ろしの際に積み荷の確認がされたりする。隠れてコッソリと違法のモノを運ぶために、途中の洋上で小型の船に荷を積み替えたのだろう』</sup><br><sup>"It must have been the case in the middle.However, in general, large ships are allowed to dock at ports or checked for cargo when unloading.They must have changed their cargo to a small ship on the way to carry illegal goods in hiding.'</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">"What, are you doing that?"<br><sup>「えっ、そんなことしてんのか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, are you doing that?"</sup></p>
<p id="L14"><br></p>
<p id="L15">"Hmm. It's called "racketeering. It's an orthodox technique that has been used since ancient times to smuggle illegal drugs and weapons.<br><sup>『うむ。『瀬取り』と言ってな。古くより違法な薬物や武器の密輸の際に行われていたオーソドックスな手だ』</sup><br><sup>"Yes, say 'Setori.'It's an orthodox trick that has long been used to smuggle illegal drugs and weapons."</sup></p>
<p id="L16"><br></p>
<p id="L17">"Huh. ......"<br><sup>「へぇ～……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh..."</sup></p>
<p id="L18"><br></p>
<p id="L19"><br></p>
<p id="L20">There are several people on the boat who are staring at us. They were wearing cloak-like robes over their entire bodies, and their faces were covered with hoods so that we couldn't see them.<br><sup>ボートにはこっちをジッと見つめて来る者が数人乗っている。全身をマントのようなローブで羽織り、顔もフードを深く被っているので見えない。</sup><br><sup>There were a few people in the boat staring at me.His whole body was covered in cloak-like robes, and his face was covered in a hood, so he could not see it.</sup></p>
<p id="L21">Two large wooden crates as cargo for the ship.<br><sup>船の積み荷として大きめの木箱が二つほど。</sup><br><sup>There were about two large crates for the ship'</sup></p>
<p id="L22"><br></p>
<p id="L23">".........mumblemumble......"<br><sup>「………ぶつぶつぶつぶつ……」</sup><br><sup>"…………Mumbling…"</sup></p>
<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25">Then, one of the robed figures on the boat is holding something in the palm of his hand and pointing it at me.<br><sup>すると、船に乗っているローブの人物の一人が、手の平に何かを乗せてこちらに向けている。</sup><br><sup>Then one of the robe figures on the boat was pointing this way with something on his palm.</sup></p>
<p id="L26">That's a magic crystal, isn't it? It mumbles towards you, and then the magic crystal gives you a ......<br><sup>それは、魔水晶だな。こちらに向けてブツブツと呟き、すると魔水晶から……</sup><br><sup>That's a magical crystal.muttered to me, and from the magical crystal...</sup></p>
<p id="L27"><br></p>
<p id="L28">"Hahahahaha, Okemaru~<br><sup>『ひはははは、おけまる～♪』</sup><br><sup>『Hi haha, okemaru~♪』</sup></p>
<p id="L29"><br></p>
<p id="L30">I could hear that obnoxious voice.<br><sup>あの不愉快極まりない声が聞こえてきた。</sup><br><sup>I heard that unpleasant voice.</sup></p>
<p id="L31">Then the person who was holding the magic crystal picked up a cloth bag at his feet and threw it at me.<br><sup>すると、魔水晶を持っていた人物が足元にある布袋を手に持ち、俺に向けて投げてきた。</sup><br><sup>Then the man who was holding the magic crystal picked up the cloth bag at his feet and threw it at me.</sup></p>
<p id="L32"><br></p>
<p id="L33">"Huh, looks like we got a Parisian to identify us. That's the package. Take it.<br><sup>『ふっ、パリピに本人確認をさせたようだな。あれが荷物だ。受け取れ』</sup><br><sup>"Well, I think you made Paripi identify you.That's the package. Take it."</sup></p>
<p id="L34">"Eh, oh, oh."<br><sup>「えっ、お、おう」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,"</sup></p>
<p id="L35"><br></p>
<p id="L36">I caught the bag that was thrown to me. Then, the people who threw the bag just did that, and without saying a word to me, they turned the boat around and went away.<br><sup>投げられた袋を俺はキャッチ。すると、投げた張本人たちはそれだけで、俺に一言も何も告げずにそのまま船を方向転換させて行ってしまった。</sup><br><sup>I caught the bag thrown away.Then the Jangs themselves threw it away without telling me a word.</sup></p>
<p id="L37"><br></p>
<p id="L38">"Hey, they're gone, huh?"<br><sup>「おい、あいつら行っちまったぞ？」</sup><br><sup>"Hey, they're gone, aren't they?"</sup></p>
<p id="L39">"They're just couriers. They are just hired for money. I don't want to have anything to do with them, so I don't reveal my identity, I don't know anything about the cargo, and I try not to ask anything about the people I'm delivering it to.<br><sup>『奴らはただの運び屋だ。ただ金で雇われただけ。関わりたくないので、身分も明かさない代わりに、積み荷の情報も何も知らず、受け渡し相手のことも何も聞かないことを心掛けている』</sup><br><sup>'They're just carriers.I was just hired for money.I don't want to get involved, so instead of revealing my identity, I try not to know anything about the cargo and ask anything about the recipient."</sup></p>
<p id="L40">"Heh, heh. ...... I see. ...... Well, for a bunch of outlaws, you do follow the outlaws' rules. ......<br><sup>「へ、へぇ……そうなのか……つか、無法者共のくせに、無法者たちのルールは守るんだな……」</sup><br><sup>"Well... I see... you're outlaws, but you follow the rules of outlaws..."</sup></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42">I don't know what it is, but people who do bad things have a lot of things on their mind. If you're going to use your brain to think like that, why don't you get a real job? ...... and I'll tell you what.<br><sup>なんか、悪いことをする奴らってのは色々なことを考えてんだな。そんなこと考えるのに頭使うなら真面目に働けばいいのに……と俺が言っても仕方ない。</sup><br><sup>Those people who do bad things have a lot on their mind.It's no use for me to say that if you use your brain to think about that, you should work seriously.</sup></p>
<p id="L43">Because, in a way, I've stepped into this side of the world today.<br><sup>何故なら、ある意味で俺も今日から『こっち側』に足を踏み入れたみてーなもんだからな。</sup><br><sup>Because in a way, I'm going to step on this side from today.</sup></p>
<p id="L44">And ......<br><sup>そして……</sup><br><sup>And...</sup></p>
<p id="L45"><br></p>
<p id="L46">"Whoa, this is it - ......."<br><sup>「おっ、これだな～……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, this is it~"</sup></p>
<p id="L47"><br></p>
<p id="L48">When I put my hand inside the cloth bag I received, I felt a square inside.<br><sup>受け取った布袋の中に手を入れてみると中に四角い感触。</sup><br><sup>When I put my hand in the cloth bag I received, it felt square inside.</sup></p>
<p id="L49">When I took it out, I found a box wrapped with a ribbon.<br><sup>取り出してみると、リボンで包装された箱。</sup><br><sup>I took it out and found a box wrapped in a ribbon.</sup></p>
<p id="L50">I untied the ribbon and looked inside: ......<br><sup>リボンをほどいて中を見てみると……</sup><br><sup>I untied the ribbon and looked inside...</sup></p>
<p id="L51"><br></p>
<p id="L52">"Let's see, ...... inside ...... first, a piece of paper ......."<br><sup>「えっと……中は……まず、紙が一枚……」</sup><br><sup>...</sup></p>
<p id="L53">"Um ...... stamped ...... definitely issued by the official procedure ...... 'fictitious person' identity card.<br><sup>『うむ……押印されている……間違いなく、正式な手順で発行された……『架空の人物』の身分証明書』</sup><br><sup>'Well... it's stamped... definitely issued in formal procedures... 'fictional person's ID.'</sup></p>
<p id="L54">"This is it? ...... Oh no, I don't want to use ......."<br><sup>「こ、これかぁ……いやぁ……使いたくねーな～……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, this is it...No... I want to use it~...</sup></p>
<p id="L55">"Don't be extravagant. You can't earn money for your trip without it. And the other thing is .......<br><sup>『贅沢言うな。それが無ければ旅の軍資金も稼げぬのだからな。で、他には……』</sup><br><sup>'Don't talk extravagantly. Without it, I wouldn't be able to earn military funds for my trip.And other than that...'</sup></p>
<p id="L56">"Oh. ...... Another ...... something like a small 'card' is ......."<br><sup>「ああ。……もう一枚……なんか小さい『カード』みたいのが……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh. ... another one... something like a small 'card'..."</sup></p>
<p id="L57"><br></p>
<p id="L58">Inside the box, in addition to a fake ID, was a small, palm-sized card.<br><sup>箱の中に、偽造の身分証明の他に入っていた、手のひらサイズの小さな一枚のカード。</sup><br><sup>A small palm-sized card in the box, in addition to a counterfeit identification card.</sup></p>
<p id="L59">The touch and elasticity are unlike anything I've ever seen, and furthermore, the surface of the card is engraved with a pattern I've never seen before.<br><sup>触った感じや弾力などは、これまで見たことのないもので、更にカードの表面には見たことのない紋様が刻まれている。</sup><br><sup>The feeling and elasticity of the card are something I have never seen before, and the surface of the card is engraved with a pattern that I have never seen before.</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">"What the hell is this?　What does it say, ......?"<br><sup>「なんだこれ？　なんて書いてあるんだ……？」</sup><br><sup>"What's this?"What does it say...?</sup></p>
<p id="L62">"......Master key......<br><sup>『……Master key……』</sup><br><sup>『 …… Master key …… 』</sup></p>
<p id="L63">"What?<br><sup>「え？」</sup><br><sup>"What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L64">"I didn't think ...... he really had it. ...... I don't know where the hell he got it. ......<br><sup>『ふっ……まさか本当にあやつが持っていたとはな……一体どこで手に入れたのやら……』</sup><br><sup>'Huh... I can't believe he really had it... where on earth did he get it?'</sup></p>
<p id="L65"><br></p>
<p id="L66">The word "master key" escaped from Trena's mouth. Does that mean this is the key?　You mean this card is the key?<br><sup>トレイナの口から洩れた、「マスターキー」という言葉。つまり、これが鍵か？　このカードが鍵ってことなのか？</sup><br><sup>The word "master key" leaked from Trina's mouth.In other words, is this the key?Do you mean this card is the key?</sup></p>
<p id="L67">From the way Traina is smiling a little excitedly with a smile on her mouth, I'm pretty sure she's right.<br><sup>少し興奮気味に口元に笑みを浮かべているトレイナの様子からも間違いなさそうだな。</sup><br><sup>There is no doubt that Trina has a smile around her mouth a little excitedly.</sup></p>
<p id="L68">So this is what Traina has been chasing since before she died.<br><sup>つまりこれが、トレイナが生前から追い求めていたものということか。</sup><br><sup>In other words, is this what Trina has been pursuing since she was alive?</sup></p>
<p id="L69"><br></p>
<p id="L70">"What do we do with ......?　It's still ......."<br><sup>「……どうする？　やっぱり……」</sup><br><sup>"...what should I do?"As expected...</sup></p>
<p id="L71">"No, ...... is good.<br><sup>『いや……よい』</sup><br><sup>'No... that's all right.</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">Traina had suggested that we go slowly to train me, but I was about to ask her just in case she still wanted to go quickly after seeing this master key, but she shook her head.<br><sup>トレイナは俺のトレーニングを兼ねてゆっくり行こうと提案してくれていたが、このマスターキーを目の当たりにして、やっぱり早く行きたいんじゃないかと思って念のため聞こうとしたが、トレイナは首を横に振った。</sup><br><sup>Trina suggested that I go slowly for my training, but when I saw this master key, I thought I might want to go soon, so I tried to ask her, but Trina shook her head.</sup></p>
<p id="L74"><br></p>
<p id="L75">I don't care if it takes a little longer now. I'd rather be in a hurry and run into troublesome people, which would take us away from our goal. Let's go slowly.<br><sup>『今さら少し時間がかかるぐらいどうということはない。むしろ焦って面倒な連中と遭遇して、目的から遠のく方が困る。ゆっくり行こう』</sup><br><sup>"It doesn't matter if it takes some time now.Rather, it is more difficult to meet people who are impatient and troublesome and away from their purpose.Let's go slowly.'</sup></p>
<p id="L76">"I see. ...... If you say so, so be it.<br><sup>「そっか……あんたがそう言うなら、それでいいや」</sup><br><sup>"Well... if you say so, that's all right."</sup></p>
<p id="L77"><br></p>
<p id="L78">At any rate, I nodded my head, keeping this thing that Parisi had given me and keeping the guideline of action that my growth comes first for now.<br><sup>とりあえず、パリピから貰ったこれはしっかりと持っておいて、今は俺の成長が先という行動指針に変わりはなく、俺も頷いた。</sup><br><sup>First of all, I gave it to you from Parispi.I held it firmly, and now there is no change in the guidelines for my growth, so I nodded.</sup></p>
<p id="L79"><br></p>
<p id="L80">"Hey, Bosu, did you get my present?<br><sup>『やほ～、ボースー、オレからのプレゼントもらった～？』</sup><br><sup>"Yaho~ Bose, did you get a present from me~?"</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">And then, without reading the air, that son of a bitch again ...... No, I'm sure it's not wrong in the sense that he received the product of the deal, and he confirmed it ......<br><sup>と、そこでまた空気を読まずにあのクソ野郎が……いや、取引のブツを受け取ったからその確認という意味では間違ってないんだろうけども……</sup><br><sup>And then again, without reading the atmosphere, that crap... no, I don't think it's wrong in the sense of confirmation because I received the transaction...</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">"Yeah, I got it.<br><sup>「ああ、受け取った」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I received it."</sup></p>
<p id="L85">I'm glad to hear that. I wish I could have seen the look on someone's face when they saw that gift.<br><sup>『ひはははは、良かった～。あ～あ、オレもそのプレゼントを目の当たりにして嬉しそうにする、『誰か様』の顔を見てみたかったな～』</sup><br><sup>"Hahaha, that's good~Oh, I wanted to see the face of "someone" who looked happy when I saw the present."</sup></p>
<p id="L86">"......themefor......"<br><sup>「……テメエ……」</sup><br><sup>"...temae..."</sup></p>
<p id="L87"><br></p>
<p id="L88">He wanted to see how happy she was. She was a little pissed off, but she was also a little pissed off.<br><sup>トレイナの喜ぶ顔を見てみたかったということだ。トレイナもちょっとムッとしたのかむくれている様子だ。</sup><br><sup>He wanted to see Trina's happy face.Trina seems to be a little annoyed or upset.</sup></p>
<p id="L89"><br></p>
<p id="L90">"Now that you've given me ......, I'm going to use it, but ...... where did you get this?"<br><sup>「で……貰った以上は使わせてもらうが……あんたこれをどこで手に入れたんだ？」</sup><br><sup>"And... as long as I get it, I'll use it, but... where did you get this?"</sup></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">At any rate, I started the conversation so that he wouldn't take over the pace of the conversation.<br><sup>とりあえず、奴に話しのペースをもっていかれないように俺から話を切り出した。</sup><br><sup>First of all, I started talking to him so that he wouldn't take the pace of his speech.</sup></p>
<p id="L93">The content was a question that Traina had been muttering about.<br><sup>内容は、トレイナが呟いていた疑問だ。</sup><br><sup>The content is the question Trina was muttering.</sup></p>
<p id="L94">Then ......<br><sup>すると……</sup><br><sup>Then...</sup></p>
<p id="L95"><br></p>
<p id="L96"><br></p>
<p id="L97">"Onya~?　Did someone tell you to ask me because I'm curious?　You wouldn't care about that, would you?<br><sup>『おんや～？　気になるから聞けって、『誰か様』に言われたの～？　君がそんなの気にするはずないもんね～？』</sup><br><sup>"Hey~? Did 'Someone' tell you to listen to it because you're curious~?"You can't care about that, can you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L98"><br></p>
<p id="L99">"Nuh-uh. ......"<br><sup>「ぬっ、む……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, um..."</sup></p>
<p id="L100"><br></p>
<p id="L101">"Wait, but there's no big reason, okay?　It's just that I picked up ...... by accident.<br><sup>『まっ、でも大層な理由はないよ？　それはマジで偶然……拾ったんだから』</sup><br><sup>'Oh, but there's no great reason.That's really a coincidence... I picked it up.'</sup></p>
<p id="L102"><br></p>
<p id="L103">"...... what?"<br><sup>「……なに？」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L104"><br></p>
<p id="L105">I found it. No, I'm serious. It's a hundred percent for real. I just happened to find it on the ground.<br><sup>『拾ったの。いや、これマジ。本当にウソ無し百パー。マジで落ちてたのを偶然拾ったんだよ』</sup><br><sup>"I picked it up. No, seriously.It's really 100 pars without lies.I happened to pick up something that was really falling.'</sup></p>
<p id="L106"><br></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">How can that be? ......<br><sup>いやいや、こんな特殊なもので作られていそうなカード……トレイナが生前から欲していたようなものを、偶然拾った？　んなフザケタことがあるわけ……</sup><br><sup>No, no, a card that looks like it's made of such a special thing... Did you happen to pick up something that Trina had wanted since she was alive?What a joke...</sup></p>
<p id="L109"><br></p>
<p id="L110">"This guy ...... doesn't look like he's lying. ......<br><sup>『こやつ……嘘は言ってなさそうだな……』</sup><br><sup>'Hey... I don't think I'm lying...'</sup></p>
<p id="L111">"...... huh?"<br><sup>「……え？」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L112">I'm sure there are other reasons, but it must be true that he got it by accident. ...... I don't even know how he got it.<br><sup>『まぁ、他にも何か事情があるのだろうが、『偶然手にした』というのは本当なのだろうな……どういう状況で手に入れたかまでは分からぬが』</sup><br><sup>'Well, there must be some other reason, but I wonder if it's true that you got it by chance... I don't know what kind of situation you got it.'</sup></p>
<p id="L113"><br></p>
<p id="L114">Surprisingly, Traina seemed to believe what Parisi said. Well, since Traina, who has been watching Parisi for years, says so, are you sure?<br><sup>意外にも、トレイナはパリピの言葉を信じたようだ。まぁ、長年パリピのことを見てきたトレイナがそう言うんだから間違いないのか？</sup><br><sup>Surprisingly, Trina seemed to believe Paripi's words.Well, is it true that Trina, who has seen Paris for many years, says so?</sup></p>
<p id="L115"><br></p>
<p id="L116"><br></p>
<p id="L117">I'm sure you'll enjoy it. There's some pretty interesting stuff in the deepest part of those ruins. However, ......<br><sup>『ひはははは、まっ、せっかくだから楽しんできてよ。あの遺跡の最深部にはけっこう面白そうなのがあるからさ。ただし……』</sup><br><sup>"Haha, oh, come on, have a good time.for there is something quite interesting in the deepest part of the ruins.But...'</sup></p>
<p id="L118"><br></p>
<p id="L119">"Hmm?　However?　What the hell?"<br><sup>「ん？　ただし？　なんだよ」</sup><br><sup>"Huh? But? What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L120"><br></p>
<p id="L121">The deepest part of the path also has several branches. ...... Some of the buildings are too old, or maybe some idiot did it artificially. ...... Anyway, there are some paths that have been destroyed and are not passable. There are also some roads that have been ...... destroyed and are impassable, and even I don't know what's on some of these routes, so please be aware of that.<br><sup>『最深部もまたいくつか道が枝分かれしていてさ……中にはあまりにも建物が古いからなのか、もしくはどっかのバカが人為的にやったのか……とにかく壊滅的に破壊されて通れない道とかもあってさ……オレでも何があるか分からないルートもあるから、それは知っておいてね』</sup><br><sup>'The deepest part is also branched out... maybe because the building is too old, or maybe some idiot did it artificially... anyway, there are roads that have been devastated and cannot be taken... there are routes that I don't know what's going on.'</sup></p>
<p id="L122"><br></p>
<p id="L123">"...... what?"<br><sup>「……なに？」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L124"><br></p>
<p id="L125">I also thought about paving the road to get through, but it would have been a huge undertaking, and I'm good at destroying things but not good at fixing them, and I didn't want the whole site to be destroyed by forcibly blowing away debris and stuff, so I left it alone.<br><sup>『オレも道を舗装して通れないかと思ったけど、かなり大掛かりになるし、オレも壊すのは得意だけど直すのは苦手だし、無理やり瓦礫とかを吹き飛ばして遺跡全体が潰れても嫌だから放置してたんだよね』</sup><br><sup>'I thought I couldn't pave the road, but it would be quite large, and I'm good at breaking it, but I'm not good at fixing it, and I didn't want to forcefully blow away debris and destroy the entire ruins, so I left it alone.'</sup></p>
<p id="L126"><br></p>
<p id="L127"><br></p>
<p id="L128">He then added the possibility that there was something sleeping there that even the Parisians didn't know about yet.<br><sup>そう言って、パリピですらまだ知らない何かが眠っている可能性をどさくさ紛れで付け足してきやがった。</sup><br><sup>and added to the possibility that something that even Parisi did not know was asleep.</sup></p>
<p id="L129"><br></p>
<p id="L130">If you can find a way to make it through, please let me know. Well, that's it then, Bose!　Have fun!<br><sup>『ひははは、まっ、どこかの誰か様の知恵で、うまく通れる方法でも見つけたら、オレにもいつか教えてよ。それじゃ、そーいうことで、ボース！　楽しんできてね～♪』</sup><br><sup>'Haha, well, if you find a way to get through with someone's wisdom, tell me someday.Then, that's it, Boss!Have fun~♪'</sup></p>
<p id="L131"><br></p>
<p id="L132">And with that last statement, the communication from Parisi was cut off.<br><sup>そして、最後にそれだけを言い残してパリピからの通信が途切れた。</sup><br><sup>Finally, communication from Paripi was cut off.</sup></p>
<p id="L133">The forest is quiet again, and after a moment of silence, Traina ......<br><sup>再び静まり返った森の中、しばしの沈黙の後にトレイナが……</sup><br><sup>After a moment's silence in the silent forest, Trina...</sup></p>
<p id="L134"><br></p>
<p id="L135"><br></p>
