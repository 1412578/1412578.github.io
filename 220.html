<p id="L31"><br></p>
<p id="L32">He handed me a round crystal the size of my palm.<br><sup>渡された手のひらサイズの丸い水晶。</sup><br><sup>a palm-sized round crystal handed over.</sup></p>
<p id="L33">I was told that it was Coman's personal belongings, but when I received it, Parisi flipped out at me regardless of my intentions.<br><sup>コマンの私物とのことだが、これを受け取った俺に対してパリピが俺の意思に関係なくペラペラと言ってきやがった。</sup><br><sup>As for Coman's personal belongings, Paripi said to me that he had received this, regardless of course.</sup></p>

<p id="L37">"Mr. Earth, ...... ah ...... I'm in the middle of a conversation, okay?　You should ...... listen to it until the end. ...... Yeah, I think there were some good suggestions. ......"<br><sup>「アースくん……あ……今、話の途中だよ？　最後まで……聞いたほうが……うん、いい提案もあったような……」</sup><br><sup>"Earth-kun... Oh... I'm in the middle of talking.Until the end...

<p id="L38">"I don't care!　I don't know! It's more dangerous to listen to him until the end!<br><sup>「知るかぁ！　つうか、こいつの言葉は最後まで聞くほうが危険だろうが！」</sup><br><sup>"I know! I mean, it would be more dangerous to hear him out!"</sup></p>
<p id="L39">"Ugh. ......"<br><sup>「うぅ……」</sup><br><sup>"Ugh..."</sup></p>
<p id="L40"><br></p>
<p id="L41">Oh, shit. I was just about to say nothing, but that's not going to happen.<br><sup>アブねえ。このまま何も言えないままになるところだったがそうはいかねえ。</sup><br><sup>Abu. I almost couldn't say anything like this, but I don't think so.</sup></p>

<p id="L47"><br></p>
<p id="L48">Maybe it was because Trena had told me from the start not to believe a single word this guy said, but without any negotiation or bullshit, I jumped at the Parisian's offer.<br><sup>トレイナには最初から「この男の言葉は何一つ信じるな」と言われたからか、交渉もクソもなく、俺はパリピの提案を跳ねのけた。</sup><br><sup>Maybe because Trina told me not to believe anything of this man's words from the beginning, there was no negotiation or shit, and I rejected Paripi's proposal.</sup></p>
<p id="L49"><br></p>
<p id="L50">It's true that I was surprised by his proposal, but that's okay, kid. This man's presence is only poison to the child now.<br><sup>『確かにこやつの提案に驚きはしたが、それで良いぞ、童。今の童にはこの男の存在は毒にしかならんからな』</sup><br><sup>'I was certainly surprised at his suggestion, but that's all right, child.This man's presence is nothing but poison to children today.'</sup></p>
<p id="L51"><br></p>
<p id="L52">Trena was also taken aback by the Parisian, but she crossed her arms and nodded her head in agreement with my response.<br><sup>トレイナもパリピに呆れながらも腕組んで俺の返答に異議なしと頷いている。</sup><br><sup>Trina nodded with her arms folded and said she had no objection to my reply.</sup></p>
<p id="L53">But then it happened.<br><sup>だが、その時だった。</sup><br><sup>But that was the time.</sup></p>
<p id="L54"><br></p>
<p id="L55"><br></p>
<p id="L56">"Haha ...... haha ......, then ...... Mr. Earth ......, I'll give the ...... present to the other person I think is in you.

<p id="L57"><br></p>
<p id="L58">"What?<br><sup>「なに？」</sup><br><sup>"What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L59"><br></p>
<p id="L60">"No?<br><sup>『ぬ？』</sup><br><sup>"Huh?"</sup></p>
<p id="L61"><br></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63">The Parisian has a suspicious smile on his mouth. He clearly has some kind of evil scheme in mind.<br><sup>パリピが口元に怪しい笑みを浮かべる。明らかに何か悪だくみを思い浮かべているような顔だ。</sup><br><sup>Parisi smiled suspiciously at the corners of her mouth.His face was obviously reminiscent of some evil scheme.</sup></p>
<p id="L64">And the words were not directed at me, but at Traina: ......<br><sup>そして、その言葉は俺ではなく、トレイナに向けられて……</sup><br><sup>And those words were directed at Trina, not at me...</sup></p>
<p id="L65"><br></p>

<p id="L67">"The key that leads to the deepest part of ...... the ruins that lie deep beneath the old magic city of ......

<p id="L70"><br></p>
<p id="L71"><br></p>
<p id="L72">And Traina, standing beside me, looked more grim and astonished than when Palipi had declared himself a subordinate.<br><sup>そして俺の傍らに居るトレイナはパリピが部下になる宣言をしたときよりも険しい表情で驚愕していた。</sup><br><sup>and Trina beside me was more frightened with a grim look than when Paripi declared himself a subordinate.</sup></p>

<p id="L75">"Parisi...... this...... guy...... what?　The deepest part of the ruins?　A master key?　There was ...... a ......?　I thought there wasn't any. ...... Where did you find it? ......

<p id="L79"><br></p>
<p id="L80">"I don't have it with me right now, so if you let me go ...... from here, I'll arrange for it to be sent to Mr. Earth ......, and then we can call it even.

<p id="L85">I don't know what you're talking about.<br><sup>俺には何のことだか分からない。</sup><br><sup>I don't know what you mean.</sup></p>
<p id="L86">However, I can tell from Traina's reaction that it must be very important.<br><sup>ただ、トレイナの反応から察するに、よほど重要なもんなんだろうということは分かる。</sup><br><sup>However, I can see from Trina's reaction that it must be very important.</sup></p>

<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">Parippi's instructions flew to Coman. By "carry," he meant to escape with Parisi in this state.<br><sup>パリピの指示がコマンに飛んだ。「運ぶ」ということは、この状態のパリピを連れて逃げるということだ。</sup><br><sup>Paripi's instructions flew to Coman."Carrying" means taking Parisi away in this condition.</sup></p>
