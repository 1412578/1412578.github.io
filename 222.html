<p id="L1">"It's gone. ......<br><sup>「行っちまった……」</sup><br><sup>"He's gone..."</sup></p>
<p id="L2">"You let him get away with it. ......<br><sup>『逃がしてしまったか……』</sup><br><sup>'Have you let me go?'</sup></p>
<p id="L3"><br></p>
<p id="L4">Parisi and Koman walked away, and I was still in a daze for a while, unable to get my head around it.<br><sup>パリピとコマンが立ち去って、まだ俺はしばらく頭が整理できずに呆然としたままだった。</sup><br><sup>Paripi and Coman left, and I still couldn't organize my head for a while and remained stunned.</sup></p>
<p id="L5">It would have been better if he had simply escaped. I would have been able to switch immediately and try to chase him.<br><sup>単純に逃げられただけだったらまだいい。すぐに切り替えて、追いかけようと思えただろう。</sup><br><sup>It's still good if you can just run away.You would have thought of switching and chasing him right away.</sup></p>
<p id="L6">But Parisi's announcement that he was going to be my man and Coman's erratic behavior wouldn't let me do that.<br><sup>でも、パリピが告げた俺の部下になる宣言と、コマンの異常行動がそれをさせてくれなかった。</sup><br><sup>But Paripi's declaration of being my subordinate and Coman's abnormal behavior didn't let me do it.</sup></p>
<p id="L7"><br></p>
<p id="L8">"...... earth ...... is that ...... okay?"<br><sup>「……アース……その……大丈夫ですか？」</sup><br><sup>"...earth... well... are you all right?"</sup></p>
<p id="L9">"Looks like you really got away. ...... Honey, are you okay?"<br><sup>「本当に逃げたようね……ハニー、大丈夫？」</sup><br><sup>"You really seem to have run away... Honey, are you okay?"</sup></p>
<p id="L10"><br></p>
<p id="L11">On either side of me, two women peered anxiously at me.<br><sup>そんな俺の左右に、心配そうに覗き込んでくる二人の女。</sup><br><sup>Two women peeping anxiously into my left and right sides.</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">"Earth. ...... geez ......"<br><sup>「アース。……ぎゅっ……」</sup><br><sup>"Earth. . . . . . . . . . . . . ."</sup></p>
<p id="L14">"Oh, ......, .......<br><sup>「あ……クロン……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh... Cron..."</sup></p>
<p id="L15">"Scars all over ...... but ...... these hands saved us. Thank you, Earth."<br><sup>「傷だらけ……でも……この手が私たちを救ってくれたのです。ありがとう、アース」</sup><br><sup>"It's full of wounds... but... this hand saved us.Thank you, Earth."</sup></p>
<p id="L16"><br></p>
<p id="L17">And Cron smiles as he holds my hand gently, as if he is trying to soothe me.<br><sup>そして俺を癒そうとしてくれているのか、俺の手を優しく握りながら微笑むクロン。</sup><br><sup>And maybe he's trying to heal me.Cron smiles while holding my hand gently.</sup></p>
<p id="L18">I'm a little nervous.<br><sup>ちょっとドキッとする。</sup><br><sup>I'm a little surprised.</sup></p>
<p id="L19"><br></p>
<p id="L20">"Hey!　Ha, honey ...... I'll take care of the allowance."<br><sup>「ちょっ！？　は、ハニー……手当は私がするわ」</sup><br><sup>"Hey!? Yes, honey... I'll take care of it."</sup></p>
<p id="L21">"Oh, hey, .......<br><sup>「お、おい……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, hey..."</sup></p>
<p id="L22"><br></p>
<p id="L23">Shinobu, who was not to be outdone by Kron, attached herself to me with her medical tools.<br><sup>そんなクロンに負けじと医療道具を持って俺にくっついてくるシノブ。</sup><br><sup>Sinob sticks to me with medical tools like that.</sup></p>
<p id="L24">It's kind of embarrassing ......, but ...... I think I'm starting to feel a little more relaxed .......<br><sup>なんか照れる……だけど……なんか、少し落ち着いて来たかもな……</sup><br><sup>I'm kind of shy... but... I think I'm calming down a little...</sup></p>
<p id="L25"><br></p>
<p id="L26">"N-uh-uh ......-uh-uh ......."<br><sup>「ぬ、ぅ、う……つ……うぅ……」</sup><br><sup>"Uh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh...</sup></p>
<p id="L27"><br></p>
<p id="L28">On the other hand, I'm sure the princess is ...... shocked ...... to see Coman groaning with some sadness and regret.<br><sup>一方で、姫が何だか悲しそうに、悔しそうに唸っている……コマンのことがショック……なんだろうな。</sup><br><sup>On the other hand, the princess groans sadly and chagrined... I wonder what it is...</sup></p>
<p id="L29">I mean, yeah, ...... is not the time to be doing this.<br><sup>つか、そうだ……こんなことしてる場合じゃねぇ。</sup><br><sup>Well, yeah... this is not the time to do this.</sup></p>
<p id="L30"><br></p>
<p id="L31">"Cron ...... Sinob ...... ah, ah ...... I'm fine, but ...... yeah, that's right. I've got to patch up the ...... guys. Can you ...... do that for me?"<br><sup>「クロン……シノブ……あ、ああ……俺は大丈夫だけど……そ、そうだった……皆を手当てしねーと……頼めるか？」</sup><br><sup>"Cron... Sinob... Oh, oh... I'm fine, but... well... can you ask me to treat everyone?"</sup></p>
<p id="L32">"Yes, of course.<br><sup>「ええ、もちろんです」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, of course,"</sup></p>
<p id="L33">"I'm on it, honey.<br><sup>「まかせなさい、ハニー」</sup><br><sup>"Leave it to me, honey,"</sup></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35">I huffed when I saw them, and finally turned around to look around.<br><sup>二人を見て俺もハッとし、ようやく振り返って周りを見た。</sup><br><sup>When I saw them, I was surprised, and finally I turned around.</sup></p>
<p id="L36">There, everyone who had been injured in the fight with the Parisians was still lying on the ground.<br><sup>そこには、パリピとの戦いで傷ついた皆が未だに倒れたままだった。</sup><br><sup>where everyone who was wounded in the battle against Paris was still lying.</sup></p>
<p id="L37">The ones who are being beaten by the Parisians in a single blow are still there, but Machou-san and the others are being beaten pretty badly.<br><sup>パリピに一撃でやられてる奴らはまだしも、マチョウさんとかはかなり手酷くやられている。</sup><br><sup>Those who have been beaten by Paripi at one stroke are still being beaten pretty hard by Matthew and others.</sup></p>
<p id="L38">When I told them, both Cron and Shinobu nodded and immediately ran out to join the others.<br><sup>俺に言われて、クロンもシノブも頷いてすぐに皆の下へと駆け出した。</sup><br><sup>When I told him, Cron and Sinob nodded and ran under everyone at once.</sup></p>
<p id="L39">Meanwhile, ......<br><sup>一方で……</sup><br><sup>On the other hand...</sup></p>
<p id="L40"><br></p>
<p id="L41">"....... Hey, ......, Earth. ......."<br><sup>「……な、なあ……アース……」</sup><br><sup>"... you know... earth..."</sup></p>
<p id="L42"><br></p>
<p id="L43">The princesses seemed to be in an awkward mood.<br><sup>気まずそうな雰囲気をしている姫たち。</sup><br><sup>The princesses looked uncomfortable.</sup></p>
<p id="L44">Well, I guess that's understandable.<br><sup>ま、無理も無いか。</sup><br><sup>Well, it's no wonder.</sup></p>
<p id="L45">There was too much going on with the princesses.<br><sup>姫たちには色々あり過ぎた。</sup><br><sup>There were too many things for the princesses.</sup></p>
<p id="L46">He rode into the sky world, helped me without knowing what was going on, but was miserably defeated by a Parisian, and then betrayed by his old friend Coman, who ran away.<br><sup>天空世界へ乗り込んで、事情が分からないまま助っ人してくれて、しかしパリピに惨敗して、そして昔からの友だったコマンに裏切られ、逃げられた。</sup><br><sup>He entered the sky and helped me without knowing what was going on, but was defeated by Paripi, and betrayed by his old friend, Coman, and escaped.</sup></p>
<p id="L47">And me and the princesses are still separate: ......<br><sup>そして俺と姫たちはまだ別に……</sup><br><sup>And the princesses and I are still...</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">"Anyway, ...... is good for now, right?"<br><sup>「とりあえず……今はいいんじゃねえか？」</sup><br><sup>"For now... isn't it all right now?"</sup></p>
<p id="L50">"But ......"<br><sup>「しかし……」</sup><br><sup>"But..."</sup></p>
<p id="L51"><br></p>
<p id="L52">I had them fight with me without telling them many details until now.<br><sup>今に至るまであまり詳細を話さずに一緒に戦ってもらっていた。</sup><br><sup>Until now, they had fought together without giving much detail.</sup></p>
<p id="L53">So, the princesses still don't know anything about what I did in the game and why I'm still in the sky world, about Yamidire, about Kron, about Kakreter.<br><sup>だからまだ、俺が御前試合でやらかしたこと、そして今も何で天空世界に居るのか、ヤミディレのこと、クロンのこと、カクレテールのことを何も姫たちは知らない。</sup><br><sup>So the princesses don't know anything about what I did in the previous game, and why I'm still in the sky, about Yamidile, about Cron, or Kakretail.</sup></p>
<p id="L54">And in this situation, there's also the issue of Parisi and Coman.<br><sup>この状況で、パリピとコマンの問題も出てきたしな。</sup><br><sup>In this situation, there are problems with Paris and Coman.</sup></p>
<p id="L55"><br></p>
<p id="L56">"Princess ......, there are many injured people, and I'm going to do as the little boy says here ......."<br><sup>「姫様……怪我人も多いですし、ここは坊ちゃまの言うとおりに……」</sup><br><sup>"Princess... there are a lot of injured people here, and as the boy says..."</sup></p>
<p id="L57">"Sadis, ......, ......, yes, ......."<br><sup>「サディス……っ……そう……だな」</sup><br><sup>"Sadis... oh... yes... yes."</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">Sensing my thoughts and the awkward atmosphere, Sadys also tells the princess, "For now.<br><sup>そんな俺の考えや気まずい雰囲気を察知したサディスも、「今は」と姫に告げる。</sup><br><sup>Sadis, who sensed my thoughts and awkward atmosphere, told the princess, "Now."</sup></p>
<p id="L60">The princess nodded her head with a complicated expression, not agreeing with everything, but still unable to leave the situation where everyone who had been attacked by the Parisians was lying in front of her, covered in wounds.<br><sup>姫も全てに納得するわけではないが、しかしそれでも目の前にパリピにやられた皆が傷だらけで倒れている現状を放置することもできず、複雑な表情のまま頷いた。</sup><br><sup>The princess was not satisfied with everything, but she nodded with a complex expression, unable to ignore the fact that everyone who was attacked by Parisi was covered with wounds.</sup></p>
<p id="L61"><br></p>
<p id="L62">"I have a fair amount of recovery magic. I'll help you. Huw, too. Rival, carry the fallen."<br><sup>「我も回復魔法はそれなりに使える。手伝おう。フーも頼む。リヴァルは倒れている人たちを運んでくれ」</sup><br><sup>"I can use restoration magic in my own way.I'll help you. I'll ask for Phu, too.Rival, carry the fallen."</sup></p>
<p id="L63">"Yes, Princess."<br><sup>「ええ、姫様」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, my princess,"</sup></p>
<p id="L64">"All right.<br><sup>「分かった」</sup><br><sup>"All right,"</sup></p>
<p id="L65"><br></p>
<p id="L66">At any rate, this allowed me to postpone talking about it for a little while.<br><sup>とりあえず、これで話をするのは少しだけ先延ばしにできた。</sup><br><sup>For the time being, I was able to put off talking a little.</sup></p>
<p id="L67">In fact, I don't even know where to start with what to talk about, what to do about Parisi and Koman, and I don't have it all together.<br><sup>実際、俺も何からどういう話をして、パリピやコマンについてどうすりゃいいのかも分かってないし、まとまってない。</sup><br><sup>Actually, I don't know what to say first, what to do about Parisi and Coman, and I don't know what to do.</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">"Mr. Machaut, are you okay?　You look like you got hit in the eye or something. ......"<br><sup>「マチョウさん、大丈夫か？　眼とかやられたみたいだけど……」</sup><br><sup>"Are you all right, Matthew?"I think I've been hit in the eye..."</sup></p>
<p id="L70">"Yeah, ...... recovery of the eye will take some time, but ...... well, I'm glad you're alive."<br><sup>「ああ……眼球の回復は時間がかかるが……まぁ、命あってなによりだ」</sup><br><sup>"Oh... it takes time for the eye to recover, but... well, life is the best thing."</sup></p>
<p id="L71">"Yeah."<br><sup>「だな」</sup><br><sup>"Well,"</sup></p>
<p id="L72">"I'll help carry them all. ...... And for that matter, ......<br><sup>「自分も皆を運ぶのを手伝おう……それにしても……」</sup><br><sup>"I'll help you carry everyone... and yet..."</sup></p>
<p id="L73">"Hmm?"<br><sup>「ん？」</sup><br><sup>"Huh?"</sup></p>
<p id="L74">"It was too strong an enemy. ...... The world is ...... big. ......<br><sup>「あまりにも強敵だった……世界は……広いな……」</sup><br><sup>"It was too strong a rival... the world... it's too wide..."</sup></p>
<p id="L75">"That's ......."<br><sup>「……だな」</sup><br><sup>"...that'said he.</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">Mr. Machou, who had fought me to the death in the tournament, was barely able to get up.<br><sup>大会で俺とあれほどの死闘を繰り広げたマチョウさんも起き上がるのがやっとの状態。</sup><br><sup>Matthew, who fought with me so hard at the tournament, is finally getting up.</sup></p>
<p id="L78">Even Sadis is still limping around with a heavy body.<br><sup>サディスだって今でも重い体を引きずっている状況。</sup><br><sup>Sadis is still dragging her heavy body.</sup></p>
<p id="L79">This is what happens when a bunch of people get together.<br><sup>これだけの奴らが束になってこの有様。</sup><br><sup>All these people are in a bunch.</sup></p>
<p id="L80">In fact, I was a little surprised myself that I was able to evade the Parisians.<br><sup>実際、俺はよくパリピを退けられたもんだと、ちょっと自分でも驚いた。</sup><br><sup>In fact, I was a little surprised that I was often rejected by Parisi.</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">"After Yami Dire, you're a Parisian. ...... It's complicated for me, but you can be proud of your victory now.<br><sup>『ヤミディレに続き、パリピか……余としては複雑だがな……だが、今は勝利を誇ってよいぞ』</sup><br><sup>'After Yamidile, Paripi... it's complicated, but now you can boast of your victory.'</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">It seems to have been enough to get Traina's approval,......, so the fight and ending left a lot to be desired, but it may have been worth it for me.<br><sup>それはトレイナも認めてくれるほどのものだったようで……だから、色々とモヤモヤの残る戦いと結末になっちまったが、それだけは俺にとって大きな価値があったかもしれねえ。</sup><br><sup>It seemed to have been something that Trina recognized... so it ended up with a lot of murky battles, but that might have been of great value to me.</sup></p>
<p id="L85">Then, it was time.<br><sup>すると、そんな時だった。</sup><br><sup>That's when it happened.</sup></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">"Hmm?"<br><sup>「ん？」</sup><br><sup>"Huh?"</sup></p>
<p id="L88"><br></p>
<p id="L89">He felt the presence of many people coming from outside the building.<br><sup>建物の外から押し寄せる大勢の気配を感じた。</sup><br><sup>I felt a lot of people coming from outside the building.</sup></p>
<p id="L90">The moment I turned around, the palace door was opened with great force.<br><sup>振り返った瞬間、宮殿の扉が勢いよく開けられた。</sup><br><sup>As soon as I looked back, the door of the palace opened vigorously.</sup></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">"Prince, I'm on my way!"<br><sup>「王子、今、駆け付けました！」</sup><br><sup>"Prince, I just came running!"</sup></p>
<p id="L93">"Prince!　What the hell is this ......, the Sky King?"<br><sup>「王子！　これは一体……な、て、天空王！？」</sup><br><sup>"Prince! This is... what, King of the Sky!"</sup></p>
<p id="L94"><br></p>
<p id="L95">Oh, these guys ...... were there. ......<br><sup>ああ、こいつら……居たなぁ……</sup><br><sup>Oh, these guys... were there...</sup></p>
<p id="L96">The angels who had been waiting outside the palace all rushed in at once.<br><sup>宮殿の外で待機していた天使たちが一斉になだれ込んできた。</sup><br><sup>Angels waiting outside the palace rushed in.</sup></p>
<p id="L97">Come to think of it, the Sky King didn't include it as a countermeasure against Cron's dawn glowing eyes.<br><sup>そういえば、天空王がクロンの暁光眼対策として入れなかったんだったな。</sup><br><sup>Come to think of it, King Sky couldn't put it in as a countermeasure against Kron's eyes.</sup></p>
<p id="L98"><br></p>
<p id="L99">"I telepathically called you at ......."<br><sup>「僕がテレパシーで呼んでおいた……」</sup><br><sup>"I telepathically called you..."</sup></p>
<p id="L100">"Hmm?"<br><sup>「ん？」</sup><br><sup>"Huh?"</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">Then the prince muttered and stepped forward, dragging himself limp from my side.<br><sup>そう言って、俺の横からヨロヨロと体を引きずりながら王子が呟いて前へ出た。</sup><br><sup>Then the prince muttered and walked forward, dragging himself from my side.</sup></p>
<p id="L103"><br></p>
<p id="L104">"Your Majesty, what is this?<br><sup>「陛下、これは一体！？」</sup><br><sup>"Your Majesty, what the hell is this!"</sup></p>
<p id="L105">"Intruder, I don't believe you're ......!"<br><sup>「侵入者、まさかお前たちが……！」</sup><br><sup>"Intruders, you guys...!"</sup></p>
<p id="L106">"Prince, you have a scar on your face!　Oh, my God, you guys!"<br><sup>「王子、お顔に傷が！　お、おのれぇ、貴様ら！」</sup><br><sup>"Prince, you have a scar on your face! Oh, my God, you!"</sup></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">When the angels saw the prince with a bloody bald spot and swollen cheeks from having his belly blown out, they went on a killing spree and almost attacked us, but were stopped by the prince.<br><sup>腹を吹っ飛ばされて血だらけのハゲと頬を腫らした王子を見た天使たちが、殺気を剥き出しにして俺たちに襲い掛かりそうになるが、それは王子によって止められた。</sup><br><sup>Angels who saw the prince's blood-stained baldness and swollen cheeks almost attacked us with murder, but it was stopped by the prince.</sup></p>
<p id="L109"><br></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111">"Quiet!　I will not allow you to touch them!"<br><sup>「静粛に！　彼らに手を出すことは僕が許さない！」</sup><br><sup>"Silence! I won't let you touch them!"</sup></p>
<p id="L112"><br></p>
<p id="L113">"Prince?"<br><sup>「王子！？」</sup><br><sup>"Prince!"</sup></p>
<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115">"They are intruders, to be sure, but they are also the ones who ...... saved the sky world. ...... It was because of them that we realized the conspiracy of the Parisians that none of us were aware of, and they protected us from their evil hands. It is because of them that I realized the conspiracy of the Parisians that none of us were aware of, and protected us from their evil hands. ......"<br><sup>「彼らは確かに侵入者だが……同時にこの天空世界を救った恩人でもある……彼らが居たからこそ、僕たちの誰もが気づけなかったパリピの陰謀に気づき、そしてその悪の手から守ってくれたのだから……」</sup><br><sup>"They are certainly invaders, but at the same time they are the benefactors who saved this heavenly world... because they were there, they realized the conspiracy of Parisi that none of us had noticed, and protected us from its evil hands..."</sup></p>
<p id="L116"><br></p>
<p id="L117">"What the hell?<br><sup>「「「ッッ！！？？」」」</sup><br><sup>"'Huh!!?'"</sup></p>
<p id="L118"><br></p>
<p id="L119"><br></p>
<p id="L120">The words of the prince, who had seen the whole thing so far, astounded the angels to the point that they were all speechless.<br><sup>これまでのことを一部始終見ていた王子の言葉に、天使たちは誰もが言葉を失うほど驚愕している。</sup><br><sup>The angels were stunned by the prince's words, which had been watching everything.</sup></p>
<p id="L121"><br></p>
<p id="L122">"The Parisian ......?　Prince, what kind of ...... is that?"<br><sup>「パリピ……が？　王子、それはどういう……」</sup><br><sup>"Paripi... but?"Prince, what kind of...</sup></p>
<p id="L123">"I'll explain later. My father, ...... His Majesty, ...... and the wounded benefactors who saved this country must be treated ASAP!"<br><sup>「説明は後で。父……陛下と……そしてこの国を救ってくれた傷ついた恩人たちの手当てを至急に！」</sup><br><sup>"I'll explain it later.Father... with His Majesty... and the wounded benefactors who saved this country as soon as possible!"</sup></p>
<p id="L124">"Yes, but ......"<br><sup>「し、しかし……」</sup><br><sup>"But..."</sup></p>
<p id="L125">"Now!"<br><sup>「すぐにだ！」</sup><br><sup>"Quickly!"</sup></p>
<p id="L126">「「「「「Sure, I understand! 」」」」」<br><sup>「「「「「しょ、承知しました！」」」」」</sup><br><sup>"'Well, I understand!'"</sup></p>
<p id="L127"><br></p>
<p id="L128">In hindsight, I was relieved to think that if the prince hadn't been here, I would have been in a mess again.<br><sup>今にして思うと、もしこの場に王子がいなかったら、またメンドクサイことになってたかと思うとホッとした。</sup><br><sup>Now that I think about it, I was relieved to think that if it had not been for the prince, I would have had a hard time again.</sup></p>
<p id="L129"><br></p>
<p id="L130">"It looks like you've read my mind, at least. You."<br><sup>「一応、空気は読んでくれたみたいだな。あんた」</sup><br><sup>"You seem to have read the atmosphere, just in case.You."</sup></p>
<p id="L131">"...... can't ...... be humiliated any longer. ......"<br><sup>「……これ以上……恥は晒せないさ……」</sup><br><sup>"...I can't expose myself to any more shame..."</sup></p>
<p id="L132"><br></p>
<p id="L133">The prince replies, biting his lip at my sarcasm.<br><sup>俺の皮肉に唇を噛みしめながらそう答える王子。</sup><br><sup>The prince answered so, biting his lips at my irony.</sup></p>
<p id="L134">I'm sure he's had a lot of shocks in his life. ...... The injury on his cheek is because I punched him, to be honest.<br><sup>こいつもこいつで色々とショックが続いただろうからな……つか、こいつの頬の怪我はぶっちゃけ、俺が殴ったからだしな。</sup><br><sup>He must have had a lot of shocks with this one, too.Well, the injury to his cheek was outright, because I hit him.</sup></p>
<p id="L135"><br></p>
<p id="L136">"But it's not you, it's your father's orders,...... and you were tricked,...... and in the end it's all the fault of the Parisians. I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one.<br><sup>「つっても、あんたというよりはハｇ……親父さんの命令で、……つか騙されて……まぁ、結果的にはパリピが全部悪いんだから、あんたがそこまで気に病むことでもねーんじゃないのか？」</sup><br><sup>"But it's not you, it's Hag... it's your father's order... it's tricked... it's all Parisi's fault in the end, so isn't it something that bothers you that much?"</sup></p>
<p id="L137">"It doesn't work like that. I followed my father's orders and the Parisian's words, ...... all for the sake of ...... my desire to be recognized. I didn't see ...... anything."<br><sup>「そんなわけにいかないさ。僕は父の命令やパリピの言葉に従って……全ては……ただ……僕が認められたかったという欲求のために……何も見えてなかったのだから」</sup><br><sup>"I can't do that.I followed my father's orders and Paripi's words... everything... just... because of my desire to be recognized... I couldn't see anything."</sup></p>
<p id="L138">"I wanted to be recognized. ......?"<br><sup>「認められたかった……か」</sup><br><sup>"I wanted to be recognized..."</sup></p>

<p id="L140">"Okay.<br><sup>「そうか」</sup><br><sup>"I see,"</sup></p>
<p id="L141">"I don't know if this is a thank you to you guys, but ...... I'll take care of the Yamidire thing too."<br><sup>「君たちには礼になるか分からないが……ヤミディレの件も……僕が何とかしよう」</sup><br><sup>"I don't know if I can thank you all, but... about the Yamidile... I'll do something about it."</sup></p>

<p id="L144">Speaking of which, Cron's ability to see into that bald man's past gave me a glimpse into the circumstances that led to that.<br><sup>そういえば、クロンの能力であのハゲの過去を見て、ああなった事情を垣間見ることができた。</sup><br><sup>Come to think of it, Cron's ability gave me a glimpse of the bald past.</sup></p>
<p id="L145">And then there was the delicate relationship between him and the bald man, and what he himself wanted.<br><sup>そして、こいつとハゲが微妙な関係であることと、そしてこいつ自身が何を望んでいたのかも。</sup><br><sup>And the subtle relationship between him and baldness, and what he himself wanted.</sup></p>

<p id="L147">--Do you really want to be recognized, even by parents like that?<br><sup>――あんな親でも認められたいものなのか？</sup><br><sup>--do you want to be recognized by such a parent?</sup></p>

<p id="L149">I laughed, thinking that it wasn't something I could say.<br><sup>俺が言えたことじゃねえなと、今更ながら笑っちまった。</sup><br><sup>I laughed at the thought that it was not something I could have said.</sup></p>

<p id="L152"><br></p>
<p id="L153">That's when I remembered something. Or rather, I realized something.<br><sup>そのとき、俺はあることを思い出した。というか、気づいた。</sup><br><sup>Then I remembered something.I mean, I noticed.</sup></p>
<p id="L154"><br></p>
<p id="L155">"...... Hey, Princess."<br><sup>「……おい、姫」</sup><br><sup>"...hey, princess,"</sup></p>
<p id="L156">"Hmm?　Oh, what is it, Earth?

Oh, what, Earth.Wow, do you have anything to tell me?Yeah, what?Can you tell me the situation?"</sup></p>
<p id="L157"><br></p>
<p id="L158">When I called out to the princess, who was working on her handiwork, she suddenly looked up as if in a panic and bit into me quickly.<br><sup>手当の作業をしている姫に声をかけると、急に慌てたように顔を上げて早口で食いついてきた。</sup><br><sup>When I called out to the princess who was working on the allowance, she suddenly looked up and bit me quickly.</sup></p>

<p id="L160">"No, it's more like ...... the princesses came here, but ...... what are they ...... doing with my dad and mom?　My mom was there at Cantidan,......, and if Hu had learned to transfer space, she could have come with us,......."<br><sup>「いや、事情というよりは……姫たちはここに来てくれたが……その……親父や母さんは何やってんだ？　カンティーダンでは母さんも居たし……フーが空間転移覚えたんだったら、一緒に来れたんじゃ……」</sup><br><sup>"No, it's not like the situation... the princesses came here... well... what are your father and mother doing?In Kantidan, my mother was there... if Fu had memorized spatial transition, he could have come with me..."</sup></p>

<p id="L162"><br></p>
<p id="L163">A little disappointed that it was not what she had expected, the princess dropped her shoulders, but quickly looked up.<br><sup>思ってたのと違ったのか、少しガックリと姫は肩を落とすが、すぐに顔を上げた。</sup><br><sup>Perhaps it was different from what she had expected, but the princess dropped her shoulders a little, but soon looked up.</sup></p>
<p id="L164"><br></p>
<p id="L165"><br></p>
<p id="L166">"After you and Sadis disappeared in Kantidan,......, Lord Maam discovered the existence of the Sixth High Yamidire. After that, your friend, a half-demon named Bro,......, didn't tell you anything about himself, but when he looked into his background, he suspected that he was from Kakreterre,...... and that he had connections with the Yamidire.

Maam perceived the existence of the Six Hegemonic Yamidile.After that, your friend, Bro, a semi-magic tribe... I didn't say anything myself, but when I checked my background, I found out that I was from Kakretail... and I suspected that I had a connection with Yamidire, so I thought you were in Kakretail."</sup></p>
<p id="L167"><br></p>
<p id="L168">"...... ah ......"<br><sup>「……ああ……」</sup><br><sup>"...oh..."</sup></p>
<p id="L169"><br></p>
<p id="L170"><br></p>
<p id="L171">At that moment, Kuron, Machou and the others reacted to Bro's name, but the princess continued on regardless.<br><sup>そのとき、クロンやマチョウさんたちがブロの名に反応するが、構わず姫は続ける。</sup><br><sup>Then Cron and Matthew react to Bro's name, but the princess continues regardless.</sup></p>
<p id="L172"><br></p>
<p id="L173">"However, Kakreterre is a closed country. In the meantime, because of the politics involved, we were excluded from the survey team to Kakreter, and furthermore, Kakreter has been covered by a ward since one day, so we can't land there.

<p id="L174"><br></p>
<p id="L175">I see. ...... So Fu has mastered the magic of spatial transfer in the past few months. ...... I mean, isn't spatial transfer kind of forbidden?　I'm not sure what to make of it.<br><sup>なるほど……それでフーが空間転移の魔法をこの数ヶ月で習得したと……つか、空間転移とか禁術みたいなもんじゃないっけ？　ヤミディレはアッサリ使ってたけど。</sup><br><sup>I see... that's why Fu learned the magic of spatial transition in the past few months... or maybe it's like spatial transition or prohibition?I used to use Yamidire a lot.</sup></p>
<p id="L176">I'm sure you'll be able to figure out how to do it.　Huh?<br><sup>ま、とはいえ習得できちゃうあたり、やっぱフーも……ん？　あれ？</sup><br><sup>Well, after all, when I can learn, Fu... Huh? Huh?</sup></p>
<p id="L177"><br></p>
<p id="L178">"...... an investigative unit to Cactaire?"<br><sup>「……カクレテールへの調査部隊？」</sup><br><sup>"... an investigation team to Kakretail?"</sup></p>
<p id="L179"><br></p>
<p id="L180">At that moment, one word that the princess said stuck with me.<br><sup>そのとき、姫が口にしたある言葉が引っかかった。</sup><br><sup>At that moment the princess's words fell forfeited.</sup></p>
<p id="L181">Cakretail survey.<br><sup>カクレテール調査。</sup><br><sup>cacletail survey</sup></p>
<p id="L182">I mean, they knew I was in Kakretele. Or rather, they suspected it.<br><sup>つまり、親父たちは俺がカクレテールに居ると分かっていた。というか疑っていた。</sup><br><sup>In other words, my fathers knew I was in Kakretail.I mean, I was suspicious.</sup></p>
<p id="L183">But I couldn't get inside because of the Yamidire warding, so until now I've been ...... that?　But now the warding is ......<br><sup>しかし、ヤミディレの結界で中に入れなかったので今までは……あれ？　でも、今は結界が……</sup><br><sup>But I couldn't get in because of the boundary of Yamidile, so until now...

<p id="L185">"Earth?"<br><sup>「アース？」</sup><br><sup>"Earth?"</sup></p>

<p id="L187">Now, Yamidire is trapped in this sky world.<br><sup>今、ヤミディレはこの天空世界で囚われている。</sup><br><sup>Now, Yamidile is being held captive in this heavenly world.</sup></p>
<p id="L188">So no more cakretail warding.<br><sup>だからもうカクレテールの結界はない。</sup><br><sup>Therefore, there is no boundaries for Kakretail anymore.</sup></p>
<p id="L189">What if my dads were checking on me near Kakuretail?　What if they find out that we don't have wards now?<br><sup>もし、親父たちがカクレテールの近くで様子を伺っていたら？　今、結界がないことがバレたら？</sup><br><sup>What if your fathers were watching you near Kakretail?What if they found out that there was no boundary now?</sup></p>

<p id="L192">What's that?　If that's the case, I'm going to go back to Kakretele. ......
