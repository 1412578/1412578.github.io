<p id="L1">I don't know what's going on, but I'm getting a headache.<br><sup>何だか訳わからな過ぎて頭が痛くなってきた。</sup><br><sup>I'm starting to have a headache because I don't know why.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">The mysterious woman who appeared out of nowhere was Espy, one of the seven heroes, who knew me and was a pain in the ass who tried to beat me up with some incomprehensible accusation.<br><sup>突然現れた謎の女は、なんと七勇者の一人のエスピで俺のことを知っており、なんか訳の分からん因縁を押し付けて俺を殴ろうとする頭の痛い奴。</sup><br><sup>The mysterious woman who suddenly appeared knew me with one of the Seven Braves, and she had a headache trying to hit me with an unreasonable fate.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">On the other hand, he is a strange man who seems to have an extraordinary obsession with Cary, and even brought the secret coffee to me when we had just met, and in fact tried to cook with me.<br><sup>一方で、カリーに並々ならぬ執念があるのか、出会ったばかりの俺のところまでワザワザ隠し味のコーヒーを持ってきて、それどころか一緒に調理しようとしてくる変な男。</sup><br><sup>On the other hand, Curry may have extraordinary tenacity, but he brings me coffee with a hidden flavor and tries to cook with me.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">If you think that such a woman and a man have given off a tentative air, ......<br><sup>そんな女と男が一触即発の空気を出したかと思えば……</sup><br><sup>If such a woman and a man gave off an explosive atmosphere...</sup></p>
<p id="L5"><br></p>
<p id="L6">"What are you, a couple?<br><sup>「って、お前らカップルかよッ！？」</sup><br><sup>"Are you a couple?"</sup></p>
<p id="L7">"Oh my God, ......, there's such a connection to .......<br><sup>『なんと……そんな繋がりが……』</sup><br><sup>'Oh, my God... that kind of connection...'</sup></p>
<p id="L8"><br></p>
<p id="L9">I tsked at her, and Traina let out a sigh of exasperation.<br><sup>思わず俺がツッコみ入れて、トレイナも呆れたように溜息を吐いた。</sup><br><sup>I accidentally put it in and Trina breathed a sigh of astonishment.</sup></p>
<p id="L10">Then Espy and Slayer looked at me and said ......<br><sup>すると、エスピとスレイヤはこっちを見て……</sup><br><sup>Then Espi and Slayer looked this way...</sup></p>
<p id="L11"><br></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">"Because we're not married. I didn't have a wedding. That's why I don't have any children. You have to get permission from each other's families before you get married or have a wedding."<br><sup>「「結婚はしてないから。結婚式やってないから。だから、子供も居ないから。結婚も結婚式もちゃんと互いの家族に許可を貰ってからじゃないとね」」</sup><br><sup>"'I'm not married.We didn't have a wedding.So I don't have any children.You have to get permission from each other's families before you get married and weddings."</sup></p>
<p id="L14"><br></p>
<p id="L15">"No, I haven't heard anything!　I mean, I'm not even interested!　I'm not interested! I mean, we were about to fight just now, and now you're saying every word in perfect harmony?<br><sup>「いや、何も聞いてねえし！　ってか、興味もねえし！　つか、さっきまで喧嘩しそうだったのに、ここで一言一句息ぴったりかよ！？」</sup><br><sup>"No, I haven't heard anything!"I mean, I'm not interested!Well, I was going to fight until a while ago, but every word here is perfect for you!?</sup></p>
<p id="L16"><br></p>
<p id="L17"><br></p>
<p id="L18">I was certainly surprised when they told me they were lovers. But that doesn't matter.<br><sup>二人が恋人だと言われて確かに驚いた。だが、別にだからどうってことねぇ。</sup><br><sup>I was certainly surprised to hear that they were lovers.But it doesn't matter because of that.</sup></p>
<p id="L19">I mean, they are so self-centered that they will do whatever they want without regard to other people's circumstances, which makes them perfect for each other.<br><sup>つーか、人の事情もお構いなしに自分勝手なことをしてくるこの自己中ぶり、お似合い同士とも言える。</sup><br><sup>In other words, it can be said that they look good on each other because they do selfish things regardless of other people's circumstances.</sup></p>
<p id="L20">Well, I don't know if it's a good idea for two self-centered people to hang out with each other, but I'm not interested in anything to begin with, so it doesn't matter.<br><sup>まぁ、互いに自己中同士が付き合うのはどうなのかとも思うが、そもそも俺には何の興味もねえし、関係ない。</sup><br><sup>Well, I don't think it's good for both of us to go out with each other, but it doesn't matter to me at all.</sup></p>
<p id="L21">However, they blatantly let out a sigh at my words.<br><sup>だが、そんな俺の言葉に二人は露骨に溜息吐いた。</sup><br><sup>But at my words, they breathed out loud.</sup></p>
<p id="L22"><br></p>
<p id="L23">"Ha~ did you hear that for a second, Slayer?　He's saying things like that?"<br><sup>「は～、ちょっと聞いたかな、スレイヤくん？　あんなこと言ってるよ？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, did you hear that, Slayer?"That's what I'm saying."</sup></p>
<p id="L24">"It's absolutely horrible, isn't it?"<br><sup>「まったく、ひどいものだよね」</sup><br><sup>"It's a terrible thing, isn't it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L25">"I'm already twenty-three, after all.　It's not uncommon for people to get married in their teens, and I hope you can understand why I'm still not married.　You're an idiot, aren't you?<br><sup>「私はもうなんだかんだで二十三だよ？　十代で結婚する人も珍しくない今の世の中で未だに結婚してない事情をお察しして欲しいよねえ？　おバカさんだよね？」</sup><br><sup>"I'm already 23 years old.You want me to understand that it's not uncommon for teenagers to get married in this world, are you?You're a fool, aren't you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L26">"Marriage should not be consummated by mutual feelings alone. Naturally, you can only step into happiness if you are blessed by the people you love. You're a fool if you don't understand that.<br><sup>「結婚というのは互いの気持ちだけで成立させちゃダメなんだよ。当然、大切な人たちに祝福されて初めて幸せに踏み出せる。そんなことも分からないなんて、まったく阿呆だね」</sup><br><sup>"Marriage shouldn't be based solely on mutual feelings.Of course, only when you are blessed by your loved ones can you step on happiness.It's stupid of you not to understand that."</sup></p>
<p id="L27"><br></p>
<p id="L28">The way he talked about me as if I was a kid who didn't know what was going on with adults was getting on my nerves.<br><sup>まるで俺を大人の事情を知らねえガキと言っているかのような口ぶりに、俺のイライラも募っていく。</sup><br><sup>My irritation grows as if I were saying that I didn't know the adult situation.</sup></p>
<p id="L29">I mean, I don't know. Just go ahead and get married or something!<br><sup>つーか、知るか。勝手に結婚でも何でもしてろってんだよ！</sup><br><sup>I mean, do you know?I'm telling you to get married or anything!</sup></p>
<p id="L30"><br></p>
<p id="L31">"Child, don't get caught up in the pace. ......<br><sup>『童、ペースに巻き込まれるな……』</sup><br><sup>"Children, don't get caught up in the pace..."</sup></p>
<p id="L32">Also available at .......<br><sup>『トレイナ……でも……』</sup><br><sup>'Trainer... but...'</sup></p>
<p id="L33"><br></p>
<p id="L34">Then, in an attempt to calm me down, Traina overheard me.<br><sup>すると、そんな俺を落ち着けようとトレイナが耳打ちしてきた。</sup><br><sup>Then Trina whispered in my ear to calm me down.</sup></p>
<p id="L35"><br></p>
<p id="L36">"Thanks, I don't understand these guys ...... too well. I think it's better to wait and see. ......<br><sup>『どうもこやつら……余にもよく分からん。今は様子を見ていた方がいいかもしれんな……』</sup><br><sup>'I don't know what to do with you know.Maybe I should wait and see now..."</sup></p>
<p id="L37">"Yeah, ......?<br><sup>『え……？』</sup><br><sup>"What...?</sup></p>
<p id="L38"><br></p>
<p id="L39">Unlike me, who is irritated, Traina is calm. And she has a somewhat quizzical look on her face.<br><sup>イラついている俺とは違ってトレイナは冷静。そしてどこか訝しむ表情をしている。</sup><br><sup>Unlike me, who is irritated, Trina is calm and looks suspicious.</sup></p>
<p id="L40"><br></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42">I don't know this Slayer guy, but I don't know this Espy guy, either. ...... I used to fight him, but I don't know him anymore. Well, I knew this guy when I was about seven or eight years old, so I can't blame him. ......<br><sup>『スレイヤという男も分からんが……このエスピも……かつて戦った相手というのに、今はよく分からなくなっている。まぁ、余がこやつのことを知っていたのは、７～８歳頃のことゆえ仕方がないが……』</sup><br><sup>'I don't know a man named Slayer... this Espi... I used to fight against him, but now I don't understand him well.Well, it can't be helped that I knew him when I was about seven or eight years old..."</sup></p>
<p id="L43"><br></p>
<p id="L44">"...... Have you changed as an adult?<br><sup>『……大人になって変わっちまったか？』</sup><br><sup>'...have you changed as an adult?'</sup></p>
<p id="L45"><br></p>
<p id="L46">It's a possibility. In addition, the girl has always been intelligent, and most importantly, she was not a foolishly honest person like Hiiro and his friends, who were all about justice and cause. ...... But ......<br><sup>『その可能性はある。それにこの娘は昔から聡いところもあり、何よりもヒイロたちのように馬鹿正直に正義だの大義だのを全面に出すやつではなかったからな……しかし……』</sup><br><sup>"There is a possibility.and this girl has always been intelligent, and above all, she was not as honest and honest as the Hiroes, or as righteous as the cause."</sup></p>
<p id="L47"><br></p>
<p id="L48">"But ......?<br><sup>『しかし……？』</sup><br><sup>'But...?'</sup></p>
<p id="L49"><br></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51">Traina still didn't seem to have an answer, and clearly didn't say that Espy was an "enemy" or that she should run away.<br><sup>トレイナはまだ答えを出せないようで、ハッキリとエスピが「敵」とか「逃げろ」とも言わない。</sup><br><sup>Trina doesn't seem to be able to give an answer yet, and Espi clearly doesn't say "enemy" or "run away."</sup></p>
<p id="L52">Instead, he said, "We'll see." And then he went to ......<br><sup>代わりに「様子を見ろ」と言い、その上で……</sup><br><sup>Instead, I said, "See how it goes," and then...</sup></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54"><br></p>
<p id="L55">The only thing I can tell you is ...... that Espy and Slayer ...... don't seem to have any ...... bad feelings towards you, kid. They don't seem to have any bad feelings about you, do they?<br><sup>『ただ、一つだけ分かるかことがある……エスピもスレイヤも……こやつらは……童、貴様に対して……悪い感情はなさそうだぞ？』</sup><br><sup>'But there's only one thing you can understand... Espi and Slayer... these kids... children, I don't think they have any bad feelings for you.'</sup></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">'No, no, no, Espy's saying he's going to kick your ass!<br><sup>『いやいや、エスピのやつはぶっ飛ばすとか言ってるぞ！？』</sup><br><sup>'No, no, Espi says he's going to knock it off!'</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">"Hmm, so I don't know. These guys ...... what they want ...... and why Espy knows that the child has the master key .......<br><sup>『うむ、だから分からぬのだ。こやつら……何が目的なのか……そして何故、童がマスターキーを持っていることをエスピが知っているのか……』</sup><br><sup>'Well, that's why I don't know.Hey... what's the purpose... and why does Espi know that the child has a master key..."</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">"There ......<br><sup>『あっ……』</sup><br><sup>'Oh...'</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63"><br></p>
<p id="L64">Oh, yeah. The master key was given to me by Parisi in the first place.<br><sup>そういやそうだ。マスターキーはそもそもパリピから貰ったもの。</sup><br><sup>I don't like it.I got the master key from Parisi in the first place.</sup></p>
<p id="L65">And it was the other day that I and the Parisian connected.<br><sup>そして、そんな俺とパリピが繋がったのは先日のことだ。</sup><br><sup>And it was the other day that Paripi and I were connected.</sup></p>
<p id="L66">It was given to me as a kind of gift for forcing my subordinates to become ...... intrusive prefects.<br><sup>あいつが俺の部下に……押しかけ舎弟に無理やりなったことで、そのプレゼントみたいなもので貰ったものだ。</sup><br><sup>He used to give me something like a present because he forced me to... push my brother.</sup></p>
<p id="L67">So how does this woman know that I have the master key?<br><sup>それなのに、何でこの女は俺がマスターキーを持っていることを知ってる？</sup><br><sup>But how does this woman know I have a master key?</sup></p>
<p id="L68">It's definitely a concern.<br><sup>確かに気になるところだ。</sup><br><sup>I'm sure I'm curious.</sup></p>
<p id="L69"><br></p>
<p id="L70">"Come on, let's get Callie ready.<br><sup>「さっ、とりあえずカリーの準備をしようよ」</sup><br><sup>"Let's get ready for Curry for now,"</sup></p>
<p id="L71">"So, big brother. Let's cut some vegetables together."<br><sup>「では、お兄さん。一緒に野菜を切ろう」</sup><br><sup>"Well, brother, let's cut the vegetables together."</sup></p>
<p id="L72">"No, no, no, wait a minute, guys!　You can't just say that all of a sudden!　I've never cut vegetables before!"<br><sup>「いやいや、お前らちょっと待て！　急にそんなこと言われても！？　つうか、俺は野菜を切ったことがない！」</sup><br><sup>"No, no, you guys, wait a minute!Even if you say that all of a sudden!?I've never cut vegetables!"</sup></p>
<p id="L73">"What?"<br><sup>「「えぇ！？」」</sup><br><sup>"'What!'"</sup></p>
<p id="L74"><br></p>
<p id="L75">Why do you look so dumb? !　I'm sorry!<br><sup>なんでそんな呆れた顔してんだよ！　悪いか！</sup><br><sup>Why are you looking so ridiculous?I'm sorry!</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">"Children ......<br><sup>『童……』</sup><br><sup>"Children..."</sup></p>
<p id="L78">Even Traina!　I don't have a choice!　She told Sadis not to touch the knife because it's dangerous. ......<br><sup>『トレイナまで！　仕方ねえだろ！　包丁は危ないから触っちゃいけませんってサディスに……』</sup><br><sup>"To Trina! I can't help it!I told Sadis not to touch the knife because it's dangerous..."</sup></p>
<p id="L79">"...... obochame......<br><sup>『……お坊ちゃまめ……』</sup><br><sup>'...baby boy...'</sup></p>
<p id="L80"><br></p>
<p id="L81">Because back in the day, when I was only about ten years old?<br><sup>だって昔、俺がまだ十歳ぐらいだったか？</sup><br><sup>Because in the past, I was only about ten years old.</sup></p>
<p id="L82">There was a time when Sadis had a birthday and I was going to do my best to cook for her, to thank her for everything.<br><sup>サディスの誕生日があって、いつものお礼に俺が頑張って料理を作ろうと思ったことがあったんだ。</sup><br><sup>There was Sadis' birthday, and I thought I'd do my best to cook in return for her usual kindness.</sup></p>
<p id="L83">I sneaked into the kitchen and was about to start cooking.<br><sup>コッソリとキッチンに入って、いざ料理をしようとしたとき。</sup><br><sup>When I entered the kitchen quietly and was about to cook.</sup></p>
<p id="L84"><br></p>
<p id="L85"><br></p>
<p id="L86">--Sadis's birthday, I'm going to make him dinner. ...... Uh, the knife is ......<br><sup>――サディスの誕生日は俺がゴハン作るんだ……っえっと、包丁は……</sup><br><sup>--I'll make Gohan for Sadice's birthday... well, the kitchen knife...</sup></p>
<p id="L87"><br></p>
<p id="L88">--What?　Boy, what are you doing in the kitchen ......!　Boy, what are you doing in the kitchen, it's dangerous!<br><sup>――あら？　坊ちゃま、キッチンで何を……ッ！？　坊ちゃま、何をしているのです、危ないです！</sup><br><sup>Oh? What are you doing in the kitchen...?What are you doing, boy? It's dangerous!</sup></p>
<p id="L89"><br></p>
<p id="L90">--Oh, Sadis. ...... Oh, I'm going to make Sadis some dinner. ......<br><sup>――あっ、サディス……お、俺、サディスにご飯作ってあげようと……</sup><br><sup>Oh, Sadis... oh, I'm going to cook for Sadis...</sup></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">--I'm glad you feel that way, monk, but you're too young to use a knife. No, there's no need for you to cook. It is my purpose in life to cook for you, so please don't take away my purpose in life.<br><sup>――坊ちゃま、そのお気持ちは嬉しいですが、坊ちゃまに包丁は早いです。いいえ、坊ちゃまが料理をする必要はありません。坊ちゃまのご飯を作るのが私の生きがいなのですから、私の生きがいを奪わないでくださいね。</sup><br><sup>--I'm glad to hear that, little boy, but he's quick with a knife.No, you don't have to cook.It's my purpose to make rice for the baby, so please don't deprive me of my purpose.</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94">--Sadis ......<br><sup>――サディス……</sup><br><sup>--Sadice...</sup></p>
<p id="L95"><br></p>
<p id="L96">--Sadys will be making the little boy's meals for a long, long time.<br><sup>――坊ちゃまのお食事は、ずーっと、ずーっと、サディスが作ります♡</sup><br><sup>--Boy's meal will be cooked by Sadis all the time♡</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">--No, it's not mine, it's Sadis's!　Birthday ...... that ......<br><sup>――いや、俺のじゃなくてサディスのなんだけど！？　誕生日の……その……</sup><br><sup>--no, it's not mine, it's Sadis'!? Birthday... well...</sup></p>
<p id="L99"><br></p>
<p id="L100">--but still no.<br><sup>――それでもダメです♪</sup><br><sup>--But I can't do it♪</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102"><br></p>
<p id="L103">And Sadis wouldn't let me have a knife, so I had to go to .......　Don't look at me like that!<br><sup>ってなことがあって、サディスは俺に包丁は持たせてくれなくて……って、だから、トレイナ！　んな顔をするなよ！</sup><br><sup>That's why Sadis won't let me have a knife... So, Trina! Don't look like that!</sup></p>
<p id="L104"><br></p>
<p id="L105">"Huh, ...... so you're a very overprotective big brother, ...... is it because of Sadis?"<br><sup>「はぁ……そうなのか～……随分と過保護に育てられたお兄ちゃんだねぇ……サディスちゃんの所為かな？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh... I see... you're a very overprotective brother...Is it because of Sadis?"</sup></p>
<p id="L106">"Well ...... you still can't cook ...... that's a bit of a problem ......."<br><sup>「そうか……まだ料理ができないのか……それはちょっと困るね……」</sup><br><sup>"I see... can't you cook yet... that's a bit of a problem..."</sup></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">So, as if to ridicule me, these two couples are also ...... a big deal!<br><sup>で、このバカップル二人も俺を嘲笑するかのように……大きなお世話だ！</sup><br><sup>And as if these two bacouples were laughing at me... big help!</sup></p>
<p id="L109"><br></p>
<p id="L110">"Then what shall we do with ......?　If you can't make a curry, you can go to ...... first."<br><sup>「そうなると……どうしよっか？　カリーを作れないなら……先に……」</sup><br><sup>"Then... what should I do?"If you can't make Curry... first..."</sup></p>
<p id="L111">"I'd like to have a curry. I'd like to have a curry, but I've ...... already come this far. ...... Okay. In the meantime, this coffee is for you. You can train yourself to make a proper curry with this."<br><sup>「そうだね。カリーを食べたいところだけど……もうここまで来たら……ね……よし。とりあえず、このコーヒーは君にあげるよ。これでちゃんとしたカリーを作る訓練をするんだね」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I'd like to eat Curry... now that I've come this far... all right. Anyway, I'll give you this coffee.Now you're going to train yourself to make a proper curry."</sup></p>
<p id="L112"><br></p>
<p id="L113">Hmm ......?<br><sup>ん……？</sup><br><sup>Huh...?</sup></p>
<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115">"Children ......<br><sup>『童……』</sup><br><sup>"Children..."</sup></p>
<p id="L116"><br></p>
<p id="L117">Yeah, I guess Traina figured it out, too.<br><sup>ああ、トレイナも分かったようだな。</sup><br><sup>Oh, Trina seems to understand.</sup></p>
<p id="L118">Something suddenly changed in the air between them when they came here.<br><sup>なんかここに来ていきなり、二人の空気が変わった。</sup><br><sup>When they came here, the atmosphere suddenly changed.</sup></p>
<p id="L119">What the hell?　What are you trying to do?<br><sup>なんだ？　何をしようとしている？</sup><br><sup>What? What are you doing?</sup></p>
<p id="L120"><br></p>
<p id="L121">"Hey, ......, I need a favor."<br><sup>「ねえ……お願いがあるの」</sup><br><sup>"Well... I have a favor to ask of you."</sup></p>
<p id="L122">"What the hell, ......?"<br><sup>「なんだよ……」</sup><br><sup>"What is it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L123">"I need your help to get me and Mr. Slayer to ......."<br><sup>「私とスレイヤくんを……助けて欲しいの」</sup><br><sup>"I want you to help me and Slayer."</sup></p>
<p id="L124"><br></p>
<p id="L125">No, it's not. You're not trying to do something to me. You're asking me to?<br><sup>違う。俺に何かをしようとしているんじゃなくて、俺にお願い？</sup><br><sup>No. You're not trying to do anything to me, are you asking me?</sup></p>
<p id="L126">And help you?<br><sup>しかも、助けろ？</sup><br><sup>What's more, help me?</sup></p>
<p id="L127"><br></p>
<p id="L128">"Hey, everything's too sudden, okay?"<br><sup>「おい、何もかも唐突過ぎるぞ？」</sup><br><sup>"Hey, everything's too out of the blue,"</sup></p>
<p id="L129"><br></p>
<p id="L130">Then I shouted at him that I was at my limit again.<br><sup>そして、またまた限界だと俺は声を荒げた。</sup><br><sup>And again, I raised my voice to the limit.</sup></p>
<p id="L131"><br></p>
<p id="L132"><br></p>
<p id="L133">"Hahaha, I guess ...... is right?"<br><sup>「あはははは、やっぱ……そうかな？」</sup><br><sup>"Hahaha, after all... really?"</sup></p>
<p id="L134"><br></p>
<p id="L135">"Of course I do!　There's a lot of things I don't know about you from the moment you showed up until now!　The only thing I know about you is that you're one of the seven heroes, you're the manager's girlfriend, and you're kind of annoying!　And you want me to do you a favor?　Help?　I don't know!"<br><sup>「ったりめーだ！　そもそも、あんたは現れた瞬間から今に至るまで分からないことだらけなんだよ！　唯一分かったのは、七勇者の一人で、店長さんの恋人で、とにかくなんかウザいってことぐらいだぞ！　それで俺にお願いだ？　助けろだ？　分かんねーよ！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, no! In the first place, you've been full of things you don't understand since the moment you appeared!The only thing I knew was that he was one of the seven brave men, the manager's lover, and he was kind of annoying anyway!So please do me a favor?Help me? I don't know!"</sup></p>
<p id="L136"><br></p>
<p id="L137">"Yeah, you never know. Yes, I do. ......Yes, ......Well, ......I don't know how to explain it~ ......But I can't teach you everything from one to ten. But I can't teach you everything from one to ten. ...... But I can tell you this: ......<br><sup>「うん、分からないよね。うん。……うん……さて……どう説明したものかね～……でも、一から十まで全部を教えることはできないけど……ただ、コレを……」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, you don't know, do you?Yeah... well...

<p id="L140"><br></p>
<p id="L141"><br></p>
<p id="L142">At that moment, Espy held out something to me with a somewhat sad expression on his face.<br><sup>そのとき、エスピがどこか切なそうな表情を浮かべながら、何かを俺に差し出してきた。</sup><br><sup>Then Espi offered me something with a sad expression on his face.</sup></p>

<p id="L144"><br></p>
<p id="L145"><br></p>
<p id="L146">"I want you to take this and go to ...... to the ruins of Sisonotami.

<p id="L147"><br></p>
<p id="L148">"What?　I don't like it."<br><sup>「は？　嫌だよ」</sup><br><sup>"Huh? I don't like it."</sup></p>
<p id="L149"><br></p>
<p id="L150">"......?　That's terrible. I wish you'd at least listen to me. ......"<br><sup>「……あら？　ひどいな～、話しぐらい聞いて欲しいのに……」</sup><br><sup>"...oh? That's terrible~ I want you to listen to me..."</sup></p>
<p id="L151"><br></p>
<p id="L152">"This is the attitude of someone who wants people to listen to him. You're the one who doesn't listen to me and says things like you're going to blow me away!<br><sup>「人に話を聞いて欲しい奴の態度かよ。大体、テメエこそ人の話も聞かずに俺をぶっ飛ばすとか勝手なこと言いやがるし！」</sup><br><sup>"It's the attitude of the man who wants people to listen.Generally speaking, Temae is the one who says selfish things like hitting me without listening to others!"</sup></p>

<p id="L154">"Huh?　You're a man and you're whispering about small things. I'm going to kick your ass."<br><sup>「え～？　んも～、男のくせに細かいことブツクサとうるさいな～。ほんとぶっ飛ばすよ？」</sup><br><sup>"What? Well, even though you're a man, you're so fussy about details~I'm sure I'll knock you off."</sup></p>
<p id="L155"><br></p>
<p id="L156"><br></p>
<p id="L157">I don't know what they're trying to give me.<br><sup>何を渡されようとしているのか分からない。</sup><br><sup>I don't know what they're going to give me.</sup></p>
<p id="L158">However, if their request was to take these two to the ruins, I firmly refused.<br><sup>だけど、こいつらのお願いが、この二人を連れて例の遺跡を目指せということなら断固お断りだった。</sup><br><sup>But if their request was to take these two to the ruins, they would refuse.</sup></p>
<p id="L159"><br></p>
<p id="L160"><br></p>
<p id="L161">"Oh?　I've been on parade with the legendary denizens of ...... for the past few days, and I don't mean to lick your chops, but do you really think I'm going to be intimidated by the threat of one of the Seven Brave Men?"<br><sup>「あ゛？　ここ数日、伝説の住人たちのオンパレードだったんでな……舐めてるわけじゃねえが、七勇者一人の脅しぐらいで、俺がビビると思ってんのか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh?

<p id="L163">"...... something ...... really ...... disgusting."<br><sup>「……なんか……ほんと……ムカツク」</sup><br><sup>"...it's kind of...it's really...it's annoying."</sup></p>

<p id="L165"><br></p>
<p id="L166">In the event that the woman is planning to do something, and depending on the situation, force me to do something, ...... I do not want to have a hard battle with the seven heroes, but depending on the situation, I am willing to do it.<br><sup>仮にこの女が何を企んで、状況によっては俺に力づくで何かをさせようというのなら……七勇者とのガチバトルは本来なら願い下げだが、状況によってはやぶさかじゃねえ。</sup><br><sup>If this woman is going to plot something and make me do something by force depending on the situation... the battle with the Seven Braves is usually a wish-down, but it's not a failure depending on the situation.</sup></p>
<p id="L167">With that thought, I changed the air I was emitting as well.<br><sup>そう思って俺もまた発する空気を変えた。</sup><br><sup>That's what I thought, so I changed the atmosphere.</sup></p>
<p id="L168">But ......<br><sup>しかし……</sup><br><sup>But...</sup></p>

<p id="L170">"Espy, stop it.<br><sup>「エスピ、やめたまえ」</sup><br><sup>"Espi, don't do that."</sup></p>
<p id="L171">"...... muh ......"<br><sup>「……むぅ……」</sup><br><sup>"...hmm..."</sup></p>
<p id="L172"><br></p>
<p id="L173">Slayer stepped in between us and chided Espy.<br><sup>スレイヤが俺たちの間に入って、エスピを窘めた。</sup><br><sup>Slayer came between us and scolded Espi.</sup></p>
<p id="L174">Then Espy also puffed up his cheeks unfaithfully, but he didn't do anything to me.<br><sup>すると、エスピも不貞腐れたように頬を膨らませたが、俺に何かをしてくることはなかった。</sup><br><sup>Espi puffed up his cheeks as if he were unfaithful, but he didn't do anything to me.</sup></p>

<p id="L177">"It's your fault.<br><sup>「君が悪い」</sup><br><sup>"You're to blame,"</sup></p>
<p id="L178">"Oh!　Only Slayer pretends to be a good girl!　I'm so annoyed, so annoyed. Fine then. Okay.

<p id="L179"><br></p>
<p id="L180">Then Espy threw me a cloth bag, which I reflexively accepted.<br><sup>そう言って、エスピは俺に布袋を投げ、俺は反射的にそれを受け取っちまった。</sup><br><sup>Espi threw a cloth bag at me, and I received it reflexively.</sup></p>
