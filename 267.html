<p id="L2">Soldiers were placed on all sides, gradually narrowing the siege.<br><sup>四方に配置されて、少しずつ包囲網を狭めてくる兵士たち。</sup><br><sup>Soldiers deployed in all directions gradually narrowing the siege.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">Besides ......<br><sup>それに……</sup><br><sup>And...</sup></p>
<p id="L4"><br></p>
<p id="L5">"Oh, another bow!　Damn ......"<br><sup>「ッ、また弓が！　くそ……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, the bow again! Damn..."</sup></p>
<p id="L6">"Left to ......!　Get down!<br><sup>『左から……礫だ！　伏せろ』</sup><br><sup>'From the left... gravel!Get down,'</sup></p>
<p id="L7">"Whoa, damn ......, that's really annoying ......."<br><sup>「うおっ、く、くそ……マジでウザってーな……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my gosh... I'm really annoyed..."</sup></p>
<p id="L8"><br></p>
<p id="L9">He moved his body to protect Espy, but his reaction was slightly delayed.<br><sup>エスピを庇うように体を動かすが、僅かに反応が遅れた。</sup><br><sup>He moved his body to protect Espi, but his reaction was slightly slow.</sup></p>
<p id="L10">I can feel the heat from the wound as it snatches the skin of my leg thigh and cheek and oozes a thin layer of blood.<br><sup>足の腿の皮、頬の皮を掠って薄っすらと血がにじみ出るほどの熱を傷口から感じる。</sup><br><sup>He scratched the skin of his thighs and cheeks and felt the heat oozing from the wound.</sup></p>
<p id="L11"><br></p>
<p id="L12">"I can't see much from here, but they've got ...... our location all over the place, don't they?"<br><sup>「こっちはあんま見えないってのに、あいつら……こっちの位置がバレバレじゃねえか？」</sup><br><sup>"They can't see me very well, but they... can't you tell where I am?"</sup></p>
<p id="L13"><br></p>
<p id="L14">The enemy clearly knew where I was and attacked me. That was the most annoying thing of all.<br><sup>敵が明らかに俺の位置を把握したうえで攻撃してくる。それがこの上なく厄介だった。</sup><br><sup>The enemy will attack me after clearly grasping my position.That was the most troubling thing.</sup></p>
<p id="L15"><br></p>
<p id="L16"><br></p>
<p id="L17">The other party is a veteran soldier. They are used to night battles like this, so they have a good night vision. You're an amateur, you're an easy target for them.<br><sup>『相手は歴戦の軍人だ。こういった夜戦も慣れているので、夜目も利く。素人の貴様では、連中からすれば格好の的だ』</sup><br><sup>"My opponent is a veteran soldier.I'm used to this kind of night battle, so I can see well at night.For you as an amateur, it's a perfect target for them.'</sup></p>
<p id="L18"><br></p>
<p id="L19">"Nuh-uh. ......"<br><sup>「ぬぅ……」</sup><br><sup>"Well..."</sup></p>
<p id="L20"><br></p>
<p id="L21">And there are quite a few of them, but it's too quiet now to hear the enemy's orders, isn't it?　The snipers are moving right after they hit the bows as well, to prevent them from realizing their position. We are on a full-scale hunt.<br><sup>『それに、かなりの数が居るのだが、今は静かで敵の指示も聞こえてこぬだろう？　自分たちの位置を悟らせぬため、弓も打った直後に狙撃手は移動している。本格的に狩りにきている』</sup><br><sup>"And there are quite a few, but now they are quiet and can't hear the enemy's instructions, can they?The sniper is moving right after shooting a bow to keep them from their position.I'm here to hunt in earnest.'</sup></p>
<p id="L22"><br></p>
<p id="L23"><br></p>
<p id="L24">I see. That's exactly what happened with Shinobu.<br><sup>なるほど。まさに、シノブの時と同じだな。</sup><br><sup>I see. It's exactly the same as when I was in Sinob.</sup></p>
<p id="L25"><br></p>
<p id="L26">The other side also judged that you are not just anyone by your footwork earlier. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're going to do with your time.<br><sup>『向こうも、先ほどのフットワークで貴様が只者ではないと判断したのだ。無暗に襲い掛かってどさくさに紛れて包囲網を突破されぬよう、徐々に輪を狭めようというところだ』</sup><br><sup>'They have judged you to be no ordinary person by the footwork they have just done.I'm trying to narrow the circle gradually so that I won't be caught up in the confusion and break through the siege.'</sup></p>
<p id="L27"><br></p>
<p id="L28">Yes, this is where a real soldier ...... is one of war, not combat.<br><sup>そう、これが本物の軍人の……戦闘じゃなく、戦争の一つって所か。</sup><br><sup>Yes, this is a real soldier's... not a battle, but a war.</sup></p>
<p id="L29"><br></p>
<p id="L30">"Traina. I'm sure you're not the only one.<br><sup>『トレイナ。つまりあいつらは、マジカルレーダーみたく俺の位置とか動きとか把握してるってことか？』</sup><br><sup>'Treina, do you mean they know my position and movement like Magical Radar?'</sup></p>
<p id="L31">"It's not as good as the Magical Radar. It's simply a matter of night vision and, above all, intuition based on accumulated experience. It's a great way to get a sense of what's going on.<br><sup>『マジカルレーダーほどではない。単純に夜目が利くのと、あとはなによりも経験の積み重ねによる勘だ。それにより、向こうもある程度の感知を身に着けている』</sup><br><sup>"Not as good as the Magical Radar.It's just night vision, and most of all, intuition through experience.That's why they have a certain amount of sensitivity."</sup></p>
<p id="L32">"Experience or ......, that's .......<br><sup>『経験か……それは……』</sup><br><sup>'Experience... that's...'</sup></p>
<p id="L33">You're right. You lack that experience. Compared to a soldier with a hundred battles under his belt, you have far less experience in actual combat.<br><sup>『その通り。貴様にはその経験が足りない。百戦錬磨の軍人と比べて、実戦経験の数が圧倒的に不足している』</sup><br><sup>"Yes, you don't have enough experience.Compared to soldiers trained in 100 battles, the number of hands-on experience is overwhelmingly insufficient."</sup></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35">I've never been to war, so I'm a target for them.<br><sup>戦争経験もない俺なんて、奴らからすれば格好の的。</sup><br><sup>For them, I have no experience in war.</sup></p>
<p id="L36">He's an amateur enough to be used as a pawn.<br><sup>手玉にするには十分な素人ってことだ。</sup><br><sup>He's an amateur enough to make a fool of himself.</sup></p>
<p id="L37">And there's nothing we can do about the lack of real-world experience.<br><sup>そして、実戦経験の不足ばかりはどうしようもない。</sup><br><sup>And there is nothing we can do about the lack of practical experience.</sup></p>
<p id="L38">But ......<br><sup>だけど……</sup><br><sup>But...</sup></p>
<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">However, despite the lack of numbers, you are one of the best in the past and the future when it comes to intensity. The son of Kensei, Shinobu, Aka, Touro, Bro, Machou, Yamidire, Basara, Parisi, and most of all ...... you sparred with me every day. I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one who's had to deal with this.<br><sup>『しかし、数は不足していても、濃さで言えば貴様は過去においても未来においてもトップクラスだ。剣聖の息子、シノブ、アカ、トウロウ、ブロ、マチョウ、ヤミディレ、バサラ、パリピ、そして何よりも……貴様が毎日スパーリングしていたのは余だ。そのときの、追い込まれたときの集中力を思い出せ』</sup><br><sup>"But even though there is a shortage of numbers, you are one of the best in both the past and the future in terms of strength.Sinob, Aka, Tow, Bro, Matthew, Yamidile, Basara, Paripi, and above all, you sparred every day.Remember the concentration you had when you were driven.'</sup></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42">Yes. Even if you are surrounded, don't panic, stay calm, and then "let" your awareness in.<br><sup>そう。たとえ囲まれていても、慌てず、落ち着き、その上で意識を「入れる」。</sup><br><sup>Yes. Even if you're surrounded, don't panic, calm down, and "put your consciousness in" on top of that.</sup></p>
<p id="L43">Extreme concentration. Into the zone state. ......<br><sup>極限の集中。ゾーンの状態に……</sup><br><sup>Extreme concentration. To the state of the zone...</sup></p>
<p id="L44"><br></p>
<p id="L45">I'm not sure what to say. On top of that, the sensation of inhaling magic power in the atmosphere through magic breathing ...... and, conversely, exhaling a little of your own magic power and letting it seep into the atmosphere ...... and the earth... ...like a dome of ...... semicircular spheres covering the air, or as if it were the pollen of a flower or the scales of a butterfly... ...You can use whatever image you are comfortable with. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time.<br><sup>『そうだ。その上で、魔呼吸で大気中の魔力を吸い込んでいる感覚……それとは逆に、自身の魔力を少しずつ吐きだし、大気にしみ込ませ……大地を……宙を覆うような……半円球のドームのように……もしくは、花の花粉や蝶の鱗粉を飛ばすかのように……自分がしやすいイメージで構わぬ。魔力を自分の周囲に張るイメージを浮かべろ』</sup><br><sup>"Yes, and on top of that, I feel like I'm inhaling magic from the atmosphere by breathing magic... and on the contrary, I exhale my magic little by little into the atmosphere... the earth... like a semicircular dome... or like flying flower pollen or butterfly scales... I don't care.Create an image of putting magic around you.'</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">Don't suck your magic out of the atmosphere, let it seep into the atmosphere and share your senses with yourself.<br><sup>自分の魔力を大気から吸い込むんじゃなく、大気に染み渡らせ、自分と感覚を共有させる。</sup><br><sup>Instead of inhaling your magical powers from the atmosphere, let them permeate the atmosphere and share their senses with you.</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you. ...<br><sup>『魔力量によってレーダーの範囲も制限があるが、その範囲内にある全ての物が大気中にしみ込んだ貴様の魔力を通じて、貴様に教えてくれる……貴様の魔力に触れたり干渉したものの情報を……』</sup><br><sup>"The range of radar is limited by the amount of magic, but everything in that range will tell you through your magic that penetrates into the atmosphere..."...information on what touched or interfered with your magical powers..."</sup></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51">This is a different technique than Breakthrough, which strengthens one's own body with magic, or the Great Magic Spiral, which releases and maintains all magic power in one place.<br><sup>これは、自分自身の身体を魔力で強化するブレイクスルーや、一か所に全魔力を放出して維持する大魔螺旋とは、また違った技術だ。</sup><br><sup>This is a different technique from breakthrough, which strengthens your body with magic, and the Great Magic Spiral, which releases and maintains all magic in one place.</sup></p>
<p id="L52">This means that the magic power that I have been concentrating on myself and my right arm will be spread over a wide area.<br><sup>これまで俺自身や、右腕一か所のみに集中させていた魔力を広範囲に広げるってことだから。</sup><br><sup>I'm going to expand my magical powers that I've been focusing only on myself.</sup></p>
<p id="L53">And then maintain it. It's quite nerve-wracking.<br><sup>更にはそれを維持する。それにはかなり神経をすり減らす。</sup><br><sup>It even maintains it.It's quite nerve-wracking.</sup></p>
<p id="L54">You're supposed to master that feeling now.<br><sup>その感覚を、今マスターしろってことだ。</sup><br><sup>I'm telling you to master that feeling now.</sup></p>
<p id="L55">But ......<br><sup>しかし……</sup><br><sup>But...</sup></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">"Whoa, whoa, whoa!　One ...... fuckin' ......"<br><sup>「ッ、うおっ！？　いって……くそ……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, wow!? Say... Damn..."</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">They won't wait forever for me to concentrate on my work.<br><sup>俺がチンタラ集中しているのを向こうだっていつまでも待ってはいない。</sup><br><sup>They don't always wait for me to concentrate.</sup></p>
<p id="L60">If I try to stop my movement, flying tools will attack me from all sides without mercy.<br><sup>こっちが動きを止めようもんなら、容赦なく四方から飛び道具が襲い掛かる。</sup><br><sup>If we were to stop, the tools would come at us mercilessly from all directions.</sup></p>
<p id="L61">And what's a bit troubling is that when I try to do this magical radar, it takes a lot of nerves, so in other words, I can't be aware of anything else.<br><sup>そしてちょっと困ったのは、このマジカルレーダーをやろうとしたら、かなりの神経を使うので、逆に言えば他に意識がいかない。</sup><br><sup>And what's a little troubling is that when I try to do this magical radar, I'm so nervous that, on the other hand, I'm unconscious.</sup></p>
<p id="L62">If the radar is not activated, I'll just be snarling and growling, and if an attack from the darkness, which I can't even see, comes, it's even more difficult to avoid.<br><sup>レーダーが発動しなければ、俺がただジッと唸っているだけなので、そこにただでさえ見えない闇からの攻撃が来たら、余計に避けられない。</sup><br><sup>If the radar is not activated, I'm just moaning, so if there's an attack from the already invisible darkness, it's even more inevitable.</sup></p>
<p id="L63">Always moving around, concentrating and then activating ...... this ...... this is pretty hard!<br><sup>常に動き回り、集中したうえで発動……これ……これ、かなり難しい！</sup><br><sup>Always move around, concentrate, and activate... this... this is pretty difficult!</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">"What?　I'm going to fly to ...... again, and ...... I'm going to be stuck here forever!<br><sup>「ッ！？　また、飛んで……ぐっ、……いつまでもくらうか！」</sup><br><sup>"Huh!? Fly again... Geez... Will you live forever!"</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">The arrow flew again.<br><sup>また矢が飛んできた。</sup><br><sup>Another arrow flew in.</sup></p>
<p id="L68">This time I thought, "It's probably going to fly at me," and focused my attention on that a bit, so I managed to avoid it.<br><sup>今度は「多分飛んでくるだろうな」と思って意識を少しそっちに集中させてたから、何とか回避できた。</sup><br><sup>This time, I was able to avoid it because I concentrated my attention a little there thinking, "I think they'll probably fly."</sup></p>
<p id="L69">But Traina by my side, ......<br><sup>しかし、俺の傍らのトレイナは……</sup><br><sup>But Trina beside me...</sup></p>
<p id="L70"><br></p>
<p id="L71">'That's no good. That's just evading the bow and arrow with your eyes just in time to see it.<br><sup>『それではダメだ。それはただ、ギリギリ見えるようになった弓矢を、寸前で目で回避しているだけだ』</sup><br><sup>'That won't do.It's just that I'm avoiding the bow and arrow that I've come to see with my eyes at the last minute.'</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">I was the one who, out of fear and not radar, simply looked and then avoided it.<br><sup>俺が恐怖心で、レーダーではなく、単純に見てから回避するということをした。</sup><br><sup>I was afraid, not radar, but simply looked at it before avoiding it.</sup></p>
<p id="L74">Traina didn't miss it either.<br><sup>それをトレイナも見逃さない。</sup><br><sup>Trina doesn't miss it either.</sup></p>
<p id="L75"><br></p>
<p id="L76">Don't be afraid. You have survived stronger attacks. Don't be afraid of a little injury.<br><sup>『恐れるな。貴様はもっと強い攻撃を掻い潜ってきた。多少の怪我を恐れるな』</sup><br><sup>'Don't be afraid. You've been through a stronger attack.Don't be afraid of some injuries.'</sup></p>
<p id="L77">"I know, I know, ......, but my body just wants .......<br><sup>『分かってるよ……でも、体が勝手に……』</sup><br><sup>'I know... but my body is on its own...'</sup></p>
<p id="L78">'I always say, don't I?　The last thing you need is .......<br><sup>『いつも言っているだろう？　最後に必要なのは……』</sup><br><sup>'You always say that, don't you?The last thing I need is...'</sup></p>
<p id="L79">"...... heart, right?<br><sup>『……ハートだ、だろ？』</sup><br><sup>'...it's a heart, isn't it?'</sup></p>
<p id="L80"><br></p>
<p id="L81">I know what I'm doing. But my body does that without my will.<br><sup>俺だって分かっている。しかし、身体が自分の意思とは関係なくそういう動作をしちまう。</sup><br><sup>I know it, too.However, the body does such a thing regardless of its own will.</sup></p>
<p id="L82">To be honest, Aka-san and his team's punches were stronger, and I jumped in and countered them without fear of damage.<br><sup>正直、アカさんたちのパンチの方が強いし、そういうものに俺はダメージを恐れずに飛び込んでカウンターしたりした。</sup><br><sup>To be honest, Aka's punches were stronger, and I jumped in and counted on them without fear of damage.</sup></p>
<p id="L83">However, while I was able to endure the visible attacks with determination, I could not fully prepare myself for the invisible attacks and my body stiffened.<br><sup>だが、目に見える攻撃は「覚悟」を決めて堪えたが、目に見えない攻撃はどうしても覚悟を決めきれず、身体がこわばっちまう。</sup><br><sup>However, although he endured the visible attack with determination, he could not make up his mind and stiffened his body.</sup></p>
<p id="L84">What if an enemy attack hits you while you're so focused on learning the magical radar?　What if it hits you in the head, in the eye, in the heart?<br><sup>マジカルレーダー習得に集中ばかりしている間に、敵の攻撃が当たったら？　頭に、目に、心臓に当たれば？</sup><br><sup>What if the enemy attacks you while you're concentrating on learning magic radar?What if it hits your head, eyes, and heart?</sup></p>
<p id="L85">And now I'm holding a little kid in my arms. ......<br><sup>ましてや今は小さいガキを抱きかかえて……</sup><br><sup>What's more, I'm holding a little boy now...</sup></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">"Hey ......, who are you?"<br><sup>「ねぇ……あなただれなの？」</sup><br><sup>"Hey... who are you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L88">"Yeah?<br><sup>「あ？」</sup><br><sup>"What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L89">"You're not from the ...... country or the ...... Confederacy, are you ......?"<br><sup>「……国の人でも……連合軍の人でもない……よね？」</sup><br><sup>"...not from the country...not from the Allied Forces...right?"</sup></p>
<p id="L90"><br></p>
<p id="L91">At that moment, Espy, who was being held by me, tugged on my collar with his small hand and asked.<br><sup>そのとき、俺に抱きかかえられていたエスピが、小さな手で俺の襟を引っ張って尋ねてきた。</sup><br><sup>Then Espi, who was hugging me, pulled me by the collar with a small hand.</sup></p>
<p id="L92"><br></p>
<p id="L93">"Yeah, I know, but ...... I'm sorry, you can ask your questions later. I'm concentrating now, so don't talk to me."<br><sup>「ああ、そうだけど……悪いけど質問は後にしろ。今、集中するから話しかけるな」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, yes, but... I'm sorry, but leave the question behind.I'll concentrate now, so don't talk to me."</sup></p>
<p id="L94">"I think ...... you alone can ...... escape."<br><sup>「……あなた一人なら……逃げられると思う……」</sup><br><sup>"...if you were alone...I think I can run away..."</sup></p>
<p id="L95">"What about ......?"<br><sup>「……は？」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L96">"I was making a great move just now. ...... If you leave me, ...... those guys will come to me, and I'll take the opportunity to ......<br><sup>「さっき、すごい動きしてた……私を置いていけば……あいつらは私に来るから、その隙に……」</sup><br><sup>"I was moving a little while ago... if you leave me... they'll come to me, so in the meantime..."</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">Let's see. ...... What's this kid talking about?<br><sup>えっと……このガキは何を言ってるんだ？</sup><br><sup>Well... what is this kid talking about?</sup></p>
<p id="L99">What did the kid, who was about to die, say to me in a voice with no power or inflection?<br><sup>今にも死にそうなガキが、力も抑揚もない声で、俺に何を言った？</sup><br><sup>What did the dying boy say to me in a voice without strength or intonation?</sup></p>
<p id="L100">What do you mean?<br><sup>どういう意味だ？</sup><br><sup>What do you mean?</sup></p>
<p id="L101">Translation, you want me to abandon myself, use you as bait, and run away?<br><sup>直訳すると、自分を見捨てて囮にして、俺は逃げろって言いたいのか？</sup><br><sup>In a literal translation, do you want to abandon yourself as a decoy and tell me to run away?</sup></p>

<p id="L105">"Hi. ......"<br><sup>「ひぅ……」</sup><br><sup>"Huh..."</sup></p>
<p id="L106"><br></p>
<p id="L107">Oh, man, I just yelled at him.<br><sup>ったく、思わず怒鳴っちまったよ。</sup><br><sup>Oh, I couldn't help but yell at you.</sup></p>
<p id="L108">You scared the shit out of me, man.<br><sup>怯えさせちまったじゃねえかよ。</sup><br><sup>You scared me, didn't you?</sup></p>
<p id="L109">To this kid ...... no ......<br><sup>こんなガキに……いや……</sup><br><sup>To a kid like this... No...</sup></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111"><br></p>
<p id="L112">"Why?　There is no reason for you to help me. That's why it's good that you're not ...... anymore."<br><sup>「ど……どうして？　あなたが私を助ける理由がない。だからいいのに……もう……」</sup><br><sup>"Why... why?There's no reason for you to help me.So it's okay... now..."</sup></p>
<p id="L113"><br></p>
<p id="L114">"Shut up, you can't just decide what to do!　I have no reason to abandon you, so it's fine!"<br><sup>「うるせえ、勝手に決めんな！　俺にお前を見捨てる理由がねーから、いいんだよ！」</sup><br><sup>"Noisy, don't decide on your own!"There's no reason for me to abandon you, so it's all right!"</sup></p>

<p id="L116"><br></p>
<p id="L117">It's because he's such a brat!<br><sup>こんなガキだからこそだ！</sup><br><sup>It's because I'm such a kid!</sup></p>
<p id="L118">I couldn't help but raise my voice.<br><sup>俺は声を張り上げずにはいられなかった。</sup><br><sup>I couldn't help but raise my voice.</sup></p>
