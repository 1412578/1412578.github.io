<p id="L95"><br></p>
<p id="L96">I'm not sure if it's because of Hiiro, but I think it's because he's a young man of about fifteen who wavers between immaturity and youth. But because of Hiiro, he has changed his sexuality, saying that he likes to drool over young men of about fifteen years old who waver between immature boys and young men. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.<br><sup>『いや～、十数年前まではそれこそ百年間ぐらいはノジャちゃんの好みは人間の三十代……逞しくて特に髭があってダンディな男……そういうのを首輪つけて全裸にして犬のようにして、みっともない姿で心を壊して喘ぐまで調教するのが好みとか言ってたのに、ヒイロの所為か、未成熟な少年と青年の狭間で揺れる十五ぐらいの若者を涎垂らすほど好きになったとかって、性癖チェンジしちゃってさ～……まっ、好みはヒイロであることは変わらないんだろうけど～、性癖はね～、それこそヒイロの息子であるボスなんて、あの変態くそロリババアのド本命に～？』</sup><br><sup>"No, until more than a decade ago, Noja's taste was in her thirties... a strong, bearded, and dandy man... he said he liked to train his son to break his heart and wheeze like a dog with a collar on him, but he liked to drool between a immature boy and a young man."</sup></p>

<p id="L109">Something about Yamidire, who had a twisted sense of worship for Traina but somehow had feelings for Kron and Amae, was starting to look decent.<br><sup>なんか、トレイナに対する歪んだ崇拝心はあったものの、何だかんだでクロンとか、アマエとかには情を持っていたヤミディレがまともに見えてきたんだ。</sup><br><sup>There was a distorted worship of Trina, but somehow Cron and Amae began to see the Yamidire who had feelings for her.</sup></p>
<p id="L110">Nevertheless, Traina would not be in a good mood to complain about her former subordinate.<br><sup>とはいえ、トレイナも自分のかつての部下を文句言われるのはあまりいい気分ではないだろう。</sup><br><sup>Trina, however, would not be very happy to be criticized for her former subordinates.</sup></p>

Even if the seven brave men are your sworn enemies, as long as Hiiro and Ma'am are not involved, you are in good hands. I've heard rumors that he and Espy, the Seven Brave Men, used to be dog-eat-dog, but now they've become friends. This is a great way to make sure you are getting the most out of your time and money.<br><sup>『あ～、それは大丈夫。変態モードに入ってないと、ノジャちゃんはちゃんとした将だから。たとえ七勇者が宿敵だったとしても、ヒイロ、マアムが絡まなければちゃんとしてるから。昔は、七勇者のエスピとは犬猿の仲だったみたいなのに、今では仲良くなったって噂を聞いてるしね。まぁ、エスピ自体がどこに居るのかがオレも知らないんだけどね』</sup><br><sup>'Oh, that's all right.If you're not in metamorphic mode, Noja-chan is a proper general.Even if the Seven Heroes were old enemies, they would do well if Hiro and Maam were not involved.I used to be a dog-and-monkey relationship with Espi, the Seven Brave, but now I've heard rumors that we've gotten along well.Well, I don't know where Espi is himself.'</sup></p>

<p id="L137">At any rate, we decided once again that we would be working and relaxing at this fishing port, at least for a few days until we could get what we could from the Parisians.<br><sup>とりあえず、俺たちはパリピから貰えるものを貰えるまでの数日は少なくとも、この漁港で働きながらノンビリすることを改めて決めた。</sup><br><sup>For the time being, we decided once again to work at this fishing port for at least a few days before we could get what we could get from Parisi.</sup></p>

<p id="La3">This is the time of year when it's hard to go to the bookstore, but many places admit that you're welcome to buy all the books you can find, so take this opportunity to read a variety of books.
