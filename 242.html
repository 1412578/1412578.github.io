<p id="L1">I left my dad and mom with abandon and a smile on my face, feeling accomplished that everything had gone so well.<br><sup>親父と母さんに捨て台詞を残し、全てがうまくいった達成感で、俺は笑みを浮かべていた。</sup><br><sup>I smiled with a sense of accomplishment that everything went well, leaving abandoned lines for my father and mother.</sup></p>
<p id="L2"><br></p>
<p id="L3">"Hmm ......, you're in a very good mood, Earth Ragan."<br><sup>「ふん……やけに上機嫌ではないか、アース・ラガン」</sup><br><sup>"Well... you're in such a good mood, Earth Lagan,"</sup></p>
<p id="L4">"Mana."<br><sup>「まーな」</sup><br><sup>"Manna,"</sup></p>
<p id="L5">"Well, I'm a little less pissed off about it. ......<br><sup>「まぁ、私も少しは溜飲が下がったがな……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I've had a little less drinking..."</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">My dad and mom, they looked amazing.<br><sup>親父と母さん、スゲー顔をしてたな。</sup><br><sup>My father and mother looked great.</sup></p>
<p id="L8">I'm not sure what to make of it, but I think it's a good idea.<br><sup>そりゃ、まともに戦えば負けるはずのない俺たち相手にあそこまで好き放題翻弄された挙句にこうして逃げられてんだ。</sup><br><sup>Well, if we fight properly, we can't lose.After all, we were tossed about that much, but we were able to escape like this.</sup></p>
<p id="L9">Best of all, here I am, the son of my father and mother, riding in the back of Yamidire, who was also their sworn enemy.<br><sup>何よりも、親父と母さんの子である俺が、こうして二人の宿敵でもあったヤミディレの後ろに乗せてもらってるんだ。</sup><br><sup>Above all, I, the son of my father and mother, am being put on the back of the two old enemies, Yamidire.</sup></p>
<p id="L10">It's no wonder he looks like that.<br><sup>あんな顔するのも無理はねーな。</sup><br><sup>No wonder you look like that.</sup></p>
<p id="L11">Well, the one laughing the most is ......<br><sup>まっ、一番笑ってるのは……</sup><br><sup>Well, the most funny thing is...</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">I'm not sure what to make of that. If they were human, their current age would be the peak of their prime, but they look like that. You know what?　Kid. I am superior to you. See?　Child.<br><sup>『ふふふふ、しかし無様だったなァ、あの二人は。人間ならば本来奴らの今の年齢こそが全盛期のピークだろうに、あの体たらく。なぁ？　童。余の方が優れているのだ。な？　童よ』</sup><br><sup>'Huh, but they were strange.If they were human beings, their current age would have been the peak of their heyday, but they worked.Hey, kid.You're better than me, aren't you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L14"><br></p>
<p id="L15">She still couldn't stop laughing at the fact that my mom and dad had fallen for her plan.<br><sup>全てトレイナが考えた作戦に親父と母さんがまんまとハマってこうなったことに、トレイナは未だに上機嫌の笑いが収まらない様子。</sup><br><sup>Trina still seems to be in a good mood when her father and mother fell in love with everything Trina thought of.</sup></p>
<p id="L16">Come to think of it, ever since I met him, he's always been stubborn about the fact that he would have beaten me one-on-one!　He's always had a stubborn streak of "I'm better than you", so maybe he's happy to get rid of some of that resentment.<br><sup>思えば、出会ったときからこいつはずっと、「一対一なら勝っていた！　自分の方が優れている」と意地になってるところがあったから、その鬱憤を少し晴らせて満足しているのかもしれないな。</sup><br><sup>Come to think of it, since I met him, he's been stubbornly saying, "If it were one-on-one, I would have won!I'm better," so maybe he's satisfied with getting rid of his resentment a little.</sup></p>
<p id="L17"><br></p>
<p id="L18">"But you were ...... strong. The boy's parents. You can tell just by standing in front of them. Honestly, if I hadn't ...... followed the boy's lead, I wouldn't have ...... felt like I could win in a proper fight."<br><sup>「でも……強かったね。坊やの両親は。目の前に立つだけで分かる。正直僕は……坊やの言う通りに動いてなければ……まともに戦ったら勝てる気がしなかったよ」</sup><br><sup>"But... you were strong.The boy's parents can tell just by standing in front of them.Honestly, if I hadn't... acted as the boy said... I didn't feel like I could win if I fought properly."</sup></p>
<p id="L19">"Prince?"<br><sup>「王子？」</sup><br><sup>"Prince?"</sup></p>
<p id="L20">"That's the brave man who once defeated ...... Yamidire and ...... the Great Demon King, who was also the Lord that he served. ...... To those two... I'm not sure what to make of it, but I think it's a good idea.<br><sup>「あれがかつて……ヤミディレや……その仕えた主でもある大魔王を倒した勇者か……あの二人に……僕たち天空世界はパリピの口車に乗って戦おうとしていたんだね」</sup><br><sup>"That was once... Yamidile... the brave man who overthrew the demon king, who was also the master of his service... to those two... we in the sky were going to fight under the guise of Paripi."</sup></p>
<p id="L21"><br></p>
<p id="L22">The prince, on the other hand, looked back at what had just happened with a wry smile and murmured with deep emotion.<br><sup>一方で王子は苦笑しながらさっきまでのことを振り返り、感慨深そうに呟いた。</sup><br><sup>Meanwhile, the prince smiled bitterly and looked back on what had happened earlier and muttered deeply.</sup></p>
<p id="L23"><br></p>
<p id="L24">"It's a cowardly move.<br><sup>『卑怯な手でだぞ～』</sup><br><sup>"With cowardly hands~"</sup></p>
<p id="L25"><br></p>
<p id="L26">I'm not sure if you've ever heard of it, but I'm sure you've heard of it. He's persistent around here, too. ......<br><sup>と、王子の呟きに対してトレイナは聞こえないと分かりつつもツッコミを入れる。ここら辺はこいつもしつこいな……</sup><br><sup>said Trina, knowing that she could not hear the prince's murmur.He's persistent around here, too...</sup></p>
<p id="L27"><br></p>
<p id="L28">"Hmm. God didn't lose ....... Of course he was defeated by a cowardly hand."<br><sup>「ふん。神は……負けてはおらん。卑怯な手で敗れたに決まっている」</sup><br><sup>"Well, God... he didn't lose.It must have been defeated by cowardly hands."</sup></p>
<p id="L29">"...... Yami Dire?"<br><sup>「……ヤミディレ？」</sup><br><sup>"...Yamidire?"</sup></p>
<p id="L30">"That's why we have to ...... give birth to a new god ...... sooner rather than later."<br><sup>「だからこそ……新たなる神を……次代の神を早々に誕生させねばならぬというのに……」</sup><br><sup>"That's why... a new God... a new God must be born as soon as possible..."</sup></p>
<p id="L31"><br></p>
<p id="L32">Yamidire muttered a little miffed at the prince's words, and I thought I saw something fuzzy from his back.<br><sup>王子の言葉にヤミディレが少しムッとしながらそう呟き、その背中から何かモヤモヤとしたのが見えたような気がする。</sup><br><sup>The prince's words made Yamidile mutter a little annoyed, and I think I saw something muddled up from his back.</sup></p>
<p id="L33">I guess it's supposed to be pressure for me on my back. ......<br><sup>背中に乗っている俺に向けてのプレッシャーのつもりなんだろうな……</sup><br><sup>You think it's pressure on me on my back...</sup></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35"><br></p>
<p id="L36">"I'm glad I was able to say hello to Earth's father and mother. I'm glad I could greet Earth's father and mother, but I would like to greet them more slowly and formally someday. So ...... if I can get Earth to like me and become Earth's bride..."<br><sup>「私はアースのお父さんとお母さんに挨拶が出来て良かったです。でも、いつの日かもっとゆっくりと正式にご挨拶したいです。そう……私がアースに好きになってもらえて、アースのお嫁さんになることができたら……ですね♪」</sup><br><sup>"I'm glad I was able to greet Earth's father and mother.But one day, I'd like to greet you more slowly and formally.That's right... I wish Earth would like me and become Earth's daughter-in-law... well♪"</sup></p>
<p id="L37"><br></p>
<p id="L38">"Ugh. ......"<br><sup>「うっ……」</sup><br><sup>"Ugh..."</sup></p>
<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">"I'm going to have to call you 'father-in-law' and 'mother-in-law' as well, aren't I?<br><sup>「あっ、そうしたらあのお二人にも、私は『お義父さん』、『お義母さん』って呼ばないとダメなんですよね？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, then I have to call them 'father-in-law' and 'mother-in-law'?"</sup></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42">"Well, come on, you don't have to think about that right now because it's still a long way off. ......<br><sup>「さ、さぁ、そこら辺はまだ先の事なので今は別に考えなくても……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's still a long way off, so you don't have to think about it now..."</sup></p>
<p id="L43"><br></p>
<p id="L44">"But just thinking about it makes me feel happy. It makes me want to work harder. Because in order for that to happen, I have to ...... work hard and grow so that I can make Earth like me. ...... Right?"<br><sup>「でも、考えるだけで私は幸せな気分になります。頑張ろうって思えます。だって、そのためには……頑張って私がアースに好きになってもらえるように成長しないといけませんから……そうですよね？」</sup><br><sup>"But just thinking about it makes me feel happy.I think I'll do my best.Because in order to do that... I have to do my best to grow up so that Earth likes me... right?"</sup></p>
<p id="L45"><br></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">I'm sure you're right.　I'm sure I'd be embarrassed to see you smiling so innocently. ......<br><sup>ですよね？　って、そんな純真無垢な微笑みを見せられても俺が照れ困るだろうが……</sup><br><sup>Right? You'll be embarrassed if you show me such an innocent smile, but...</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">"I'm impressed that you've planned your future so well, Mr. Kron. Well, as for me, it's complicated to have Kron-sama formally greet those two. ......"<br><sup>「クロン様……そこまでしっかりと将来設計をされているのは感心します。まぁ、私としてはあの二人にクロン様が正式に挨拶というのは複雑ではありますが……」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Cron... I'm impressed that you've designed your future so well.Well, it's complicated for me to say hello to them officially..."</sup></p>
<p id="L50">"I'm not sure what to say. Besides, if me and Earth can get married, Yamidire will be ...... my mother, so we will be related to Earth's parents, right?"<br><sup>「んもう、そういうこと言わないでください、ヤミディレ。それに、私とアースが結婚できたら、ヤミディレは……私のお母さんなんですから、アースの御両親とは親戚になるのですよ？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, don't say that anymore, Yamidile.And if Earth and I can get married, Yamidile will be related to Earth's parents because she is my mother?"</sup></p>
<p id="L51">"What about ..................?"<br><sup>「………………は？」</sup><br><sup>"What about ……………?"</sup></p>
<p id="L52">"And when I have Earth's children, Yamidire will be a grandmother too!　And when I have Earth's children, Yamidire will be a grandmother, too! She and Earth's parents will be grandparents, and they will all get along well. ...... Hmmm, just thinking about it is a wonderful future.<br><sup>「そして、私がアースの子供を産んだら、ヤミディレもおばあちゃまです！　アースの御両親と一緒におじいちゃま、おばあちゃまになって、皆仲良く……んふ～、考えただけで素敵な未来です」</sup><br><sup>"And when I give birth to Earth's child, Yamidile is also an old woman!"I became a grandpa and grandma with Earth's parents, and everyone got along well... well, just thinking about it makes a wonderful future."</sup></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54">It's not the same as ...... Shinobu with her eyes blazing.<br><sup>んもうそんな目を爛々とさせて……何だろう……シノブとはまた違う。</sup><br><sup>Well, my eyes are already shining like that... I wonder what it is... It's different from Sinob.</sup></p>
<p id="L55">Shinobu makes this kind of thing seem somewhat insane, like she's determined not to let me out of her future plans.<br><sup>シノブはこういうことをどこか狂気を感じさせ、俺をその将来設計から絶対に逃がさないみたいな意志を感じる。</sup><br><sup>Sinob makes me feel something crazy about these things, and I feel like I'll never let go of that future design.</sup></p>
<p id="L56">But Cron is so pure, so congratulatory, so natural, so poised that you don't know how serious he is, but he seems serious about this. ......<br><sup>でも、クロンは本当に純粋で、なんというか本当におめでたいというか、天然というか、ポワポワしていてどこまで本気なのか分からないのに、だけどこれに関しては本気っぽいというか……</sup><br><sup>But Cron is really pure, and it's really congratulatory, it's natural, it's fluffy, and I don't know how serious he is, but he's serious about this...</sup></p>
<p id="L57">As it turns out, both Shinobu and Kuron can't help but embarrass me for the both of them!<br><sup>結論としてシノブもクロンも、二人に俺はどうしても照れる！</sup><br><sup>In conclusion, Sinob and Cron, I'm ashamed of them!</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">"Dear Kron, that's why you call me mother. ...... How dare you. ...... I mean, I'm your, my, my, my grandmother. ...... ......"<br><sup>「く、クロン様、だから私を母などと……なんと恐れ多い……というか、私が、お、おば、おばあちゃ……こ、この私が……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, Mr. Cron, so I'm like my mother... how scary... I mean, I'm like, oh, aunt, grandma... I'm like, oh, I'm like, oh, I'm like, oh, I'm like, oh, my God..."</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">And what's more, Yamidire is also groaning a lot at Cron's "grandmother" comment.<br><sup>で、ヤミディレも何というかクロンの「おばあちゃま」発言に物凄く唸っている。</sup><br><sup>So, Yamidile is groaning a lot at Kron's "grandma" remark.</sup></p>
<p id="L62">Well, I don't know how old you are, but I guess I'm shocked that you look so young. ......<br><sup>まぁ、何歳かは分からないけど見た目はこんなに若いんだからショックなのかもな……</sup><br><sup>Well, I don't know how old I am, but I guess I'm shocked because I look so young...</sup></p>
<p id="L63"><br></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">"Hmmm, so this is that Yamidire. ...... If I had shown this to the boy's parents, they might have believed me normally.<br><sup>「ふふふふ、これがあのヤミディレか……この姿を坊やの両親にも見せれば、普通に信じて貰えたかもしれないのに」</sup><br><sup>"Hmm, this is that yamidire... if I had shown this to the boy's parents, they might have believed it normally."</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">"What the hell, Prince ......?"<br><sup>「な、なんだよ、王子……」</sup><br><sup>"What, prince?"</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">"Well, or maybe it's the ...... boy that's changed. ...... In any case, he's sealed up his powers, and the current Yamidire will have no problem releasing him ...... and letting him go as far away as he wants. I'm sure you'll have no problem releasing him and letting him go ...... far away as he pleases."<br><sup>「まぁ、それとも変わったのは……坊やのおかげなのか……いずれにせよ、力も封じているし、今のヤミディレならば……釈放して……遠くへ好きに行かせて問題なさそうだね」</sup><br><sup>"Well, or is it because of the boy that has changed... in any case, he has sealed off his power, and if it's the current Yamidire... let him go... let him go far away."</sup></p>
<p id="L70"><br></p>
<p id="L71"><br></p>
<p id="L72">It was all up to the prince to get Yamidire out this time.<br><sup>全て王子の一存で今回はヤミディレを外に出してもらった。</sup><br><sup>It was all at the prince's discretion that he let the yamidire go out this time.</sup></p>
<p id="L73">The prince was taking all the responsibility from the sky world, but he smiled as if he was somewhat convinced that his decision was the right one.<br><sup>王子が天空世界からの責任を全て負うということだったが、自分の判断はこれでよかったのだと、どこか王子も納得したように笑っていた。</sup><br><sup>The prince was supposed to take all the responsibilities from the sky, but he laughed convincingly that his judgment was all right.</sup></p>
<p id="L74">But ......<br><sup>だが……</sup><br><sup>But...</sup></p>
<p id="L75"><br></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">"No ......, no ......, no ......, no ......, no ......, no ......, no ......, no ......."<br><sup>「う～……やだ……とおく……いくのだめ……やだ」</sup><br><sup>"Well... I don't want to... I don't want to go..."</sup></p>
<p id="L78"><br></p>
<p id="L79">「「「「 ah ......」」」」<br><sup>「「「「あ……」」」」</sup><br><sup>"'Ah...'"</sup></p>
<p id="L80"><br></p>
<p id="L81">"I can't go away ......!<br><sup>「どこかいっちゃうの……やだぁ！」</sup><br><sup>"I'm going somewhere..."I don't want to!"</sup></p>
<p id="L82"><br></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">At that moment, a single, weak, sad murmur brought me back from my buoyant state.<br><sup>そのとき、一人だけ弱々しく悲しみに満ちた呟きが、浮かれていた俺を元に戻した。</sup><br><sup>Then the only weak and sad murmur restored me, who had been excited.</sup></p>
<p id="L85">I know, right? ......<br><sup>そうだよな……</sup><br><sup>That's right...</sup></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87"><br></p>
<p id="L88">"Amae: ......"<br><sup>「アマエ……」</sup><br><sup>"Amae..."</sup></p>
<p id="L89"><br></p>
<p id="L90">"No, ......, no, no, no!"<br><sup>「やだ……いやったら、やなの！」</sup><br><sup>"No... I don't want to!"</sup></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92"><br></p>
<p id="L93">It's between me and Yamidire, squeezing me from the front with its arms and legs around my body, burying its face in my chest and groaning without showing its face to anyone. That's Amae, the one I took from my dad and mom.<br><sup>俺とヤミディレの間で、俺の体に両手両足を回して正面からギュッとしがみつき、俺の胸に顔を埋めたまま誰にも顔を見せずに唸っている。それは、親父と母さんから取り上げた、アマエだ。</sup><br><sup>Between me and Yamidire, he put his hands and feet around my body and clung tightly to me from the front, burying his face in my chest and groaning without showing his face to anyone.It's Amae, which I took from my father and mother.</sup></p>
<p id="L94">They chase us, crying, but when they come into our arms like this, they are still crying, angry, pouting, and whining without being convinced of anything.<br><sup>泣きながら俺たちを追いかけて、だけどこうして俺たちの腕の中に入ってきても未だに何も納得せずに泣いて、怒って、ふてくされて、そして駄々をこねている。</sup><br><sup>He followed us in tears, but when he came into our arms like this, he still cried, got angry, got sulky, and complained.</sup></p>
<p id="L95"><br></p>
<p id="L96"><br></p>
<p id="L97">"I don't want the High Priestess, the Goddess, or my sister to leave me. I want to be with you forever. ......"<br><sup>「大神官さまも、女神さまも、おにーちゃんも、いっちゃやだ。ずっといっしょがいい……」</sup><br><sup>"I don't like the high priest, the goddess, and my brother.I want to be with you forever..."</sup></p>
<p id="L98"><br></p>
<p id="L99">"Amae ......, don't cry. ......"<br><sup>「アマエ……泣くなよぉ……」</sup><br><sup>"Amae... Don't cry..."</sup></p>
<p id="L100"><br></p>
<p id="L101">"Mmm. Nuh-uh. ......"<br><sup>「む、ぬぅ……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, well..."</sup></p>
<p id="L102"><br></p>
<p id="L103">"Amae ...... please don't cry ......"<br><sup>「アマエ……泣かないでください……」</sup><br><sup>"Amae... don't cry..."</sup></p>
<p id="L104"><br></p>
<p id="L105">"Oh, Amae-chan, you shouldn't cry, Amae-chan is cute when she smiles."<br><sup>「あぅ、アマエちゃん泣いたらダメなのん、アマエちゃんは笑ってるのがカワイイのん」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, Amae-chan, don't cry, Amae-chan is cute laughing."</sup></p>
<p id="L106"><br></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">I, Yamidire, Kron, and even Hillua can only show a troubled reaction to that wish of Amae.<br><sup>アマエのその願いに、俺も、ヤミディレも、そしてクロンも、そしてヒルアですら困った反応しか見せられない。</sup><br><sup>Amae's wish, I, Yamidile, Cron, and even Hirua, can only react in trouble.</sup></p>
<p id="L109"><br></p>
<p id="L110">"Oh, no!　We have to be together!"<br><sup>「やーだああ！　いっしょじゃないとやだぁ！」</sup><br><sup>"No! I don't want to be with you unless you're with me!"</sup></p>
<p id="L111"><br></p>
<p id="L112">Not only was I sad, but the strength that went into the arms and legs that clung to me made me feel the will to never leave.<br><sup>悲しいだけじゃなく、俺にしがみ付く腕と足に入る力は「絶対に離れたくない」という意思を感じる。</sup><br><sup>Not only is it sad, but the power to cling to me and my feet makes me feel like I don't want to leave.</sup></p>
<p id="L113">But ......<br><sup>でも……</sup><br><sup>But...</sup></p>
<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115"><br></p>
<p id="L116">"Just because I'm going away for a while doesn't mean I'm never coming back. ...... Me, Kron, and Yamidire."<br><sup>「しばらく留守にするだけで、もう二度と帰って来ないわけじゃない……俺も、クロンも、ヤミディレも」</sup><br><sup>"I'll just be away for a while, and it's not like I'll never come back... me, Cron, and Yamidile."</sup></p>
<p id="L117"><br></p>
<p id="L118">"......, ......, ......, ......, ......!"<br><sup>「……や……ぐす……やっ！」</sup><br><sup>"... hey... hey... hey!"</sup></p>
<p id="L119"><br></p>
<p id="L120">"You've got everyone. Tsukushi's sister, Karui, Machou-san, the sisters of the church, ...... and the motleyards already love you like a sister, ...... and so do the people at the dojo. You'll find a lot of people who will take care of you and love you,----."<br><sup>「それによ、皆が居るだろうが。ツクシの姉さん、カルイ、マチョウさん、教会のシスターたち……それに、モトリアージュたちもお前のことはもう妹みたいに想ってるだろうし……道場の連中だってそうだ。お前にはいっぱいお前を大事にして可愛がってくれる人たちが――――」</sup><br><sup>"And there will be all of us all.Tsukushi's older sisters, Karui, Matou, church sisters... and Motriage will already think of you like younger sisters... so do the dojo people.You have a lot of people who care and love you????????"</sup></p>
<p id="L121"><br></p>
<p id="L122">...<br><sup>「でも、でもぉ……おにーちゃんたち……いないの……やだぁ……」</sup><br><sup>"But... big brothers... they're not here...I don't want to..."</sup></p>
<p id="L123"><br></p>
<p id="L124"><br></p>
<p id="L125">There were times when I didn't get a chance to say goodbye properly, and my original goal was to say goodbye to Amae alone before ...... I did my best to deal with my dad and mom for that reason.<br><sup>別れの挨拶をしっかりできなかったこともあったし、アマエにだけはちゃんと別れをしてから……というのが本来の目的で、そのために親父と母さんを相手に頑張ったんだ。</sup><br><sup>There were times when I couldn't say goodbye properly, and the original purpose was to say goodbye to Amae, so I worked hard against my father and mother.</sup></p>
<p id="L126"><br></p>

<p id="La1">Thank you very much for your support. Yesterday, the daily PV number was 330,000, the highest since the start of the series, probably due to the comicalization. I'm glad to see so many new friends of Spiral. In fact, this number is the highest among all the stories I've posted on Shosetsuka ni Narou. In this way, I will continue to weave my story, feeling that it will continue on into new worlds.<br><sup>お世話になっております。昨日はコミカライズの影響なのか、一日のＰＶ数が連載スタートからもっとも多い３３万アクセスでした。多くの新たなる螺旋の友の来訪に嬉しく思います。実はこの数値は私が小説家になろうで投稿始めた中でも一位でした。こうやって、どんどんと新たな世界に続いていくんだなと感じながら、また物語を紡いでいこうと思います。</sup><br><sup>Thank you for your help.Yesterday, perhaps because of the comicization, the daily PVs were the most accessed 330,000 times since the serialization started.I'm glad to see so many new spiral friends.Actually, this number was number one among the people I started contributing to becoming a novelist.I think I'm going to spin a story again, feeling that I'm continuing to follow a new world.</sup></p>
