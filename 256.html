<p id="L1">When I was a kid, I played the hero's party game.<br><sup>子供の頃、勇者のパーティーゴッコをやった。</sup><br><sup>When I was a child, I had a party gokko for the brave.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">Only in the Imperial City, but the four of us, me, Fiancé, Rival and Fu, are adventuring.<br><sup>帝都の中だけだが、俺とフィアンセイ、リヴァルとフーの四人で冒険。</sup><br><sup>It's just in the imperial capital, but the four of us, Fiancee, Rival and Fu, adventure.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">Just as we used mud dumplings from the sandbox instead of rice, we used fallen leaves as medicinal herbs and water in our water bottles as potions.<br><sup>ままごとで、ご飯の代わりに砂場で作った泥団子を使うように、落ちてた葉っぱを薬草とか、水筒に入れた水をポーションとかって装備していた。</sup><br><sup>Like using mud dumplings made in a sandbox instead of rice at home, he was equipped with herbs and potions of water in a water bottle.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">So, while I have some knowledge of these items as playthings or as items used as part of an academy class, this is the first time I've bought such equipment for an adventure.<br><sup>だから、ごっこ遊びだったり、アカデミーの授業の一環で使うようなアイテムとしての知識はあるが、冒険をするための装備としてそういったものを買うのは初めてだ。</sup><br><sup>So it's the first time I've ever bought such an item for adventure, even though I know it as an item to play pretend or use as part of an academy class.</sup></p>
<p id="L5">I was a little nervous about the idea of preparing for an adventure.<br><sup>冒険の準備ということで、ちょっとドキドキしていた。</sup><br><sup>I was a little nervous about getting ready for an adventure.</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">"Finally, here it is, the ...... tool store for adventurers and hunters!<br><sup>「ついに来たぜ、冒険家やハンター御用達……道具屋！」</sup><br><sup>"Finally, here we are, adventurers and hunters... a tool-shop!"</sup></p>
<p id="L8"><br></p>
<p id="L9">Gengkarn is a prosperous fishing port, but naturally there are many adventurers and people from other countries, and the town has a guild for registering hunters and a tool shop.<br><sup>漁港で栄えているゲンカーンではあるが、当然異国からの入国者や冒険者たちも多く、街にはハンター登録をするギルドや、道具屋もちゃんとある。</sup><br><sup>Although Genkan flourishes in fishing ports, there are naturally many foreigners and adventurers, and there are guilds and tool stores in the city that register hunters.</sup></p>
<p id="L10">Moreover, as it is a large city with a large population, the tool shop seems to have all kinds of sundries and is quite big.<br><sup>しかも人口が多い大きな街なだけあって、道具屋もあらゆる雑貨を取り揃えていそうで、相当デカい。</sup><br><sup>Moreover, because it is a large city with a large population, the tool store seems to have all kinds of miscellaneous goods, so it is quite big.</sup></p>
<p id="L11"><br></p>
<p id="L12">"Leader. I've bought 20 potions, 5 mana water to restore your magic, and some food."<br><sup>「リーダー。ポーションを２０個、魔力回復用のマナウォーター５個、食料も購入しといた」</sup><br><sup>"Leader, I bought 20 potions, 5 mana water for magic recovery, and food."</sup></p>
<p id="L13">"Okay, now for the weapons. I want to use my winnings to buy a higher grade sword."<br><sup>「よーし、あとは武器だな。この間の賞金で、もうワンランク上の剣を買っときたいんでな」</sup><br><sup>"All right, the rest is weapons.I'd like to buy a higher-ranking sword with the prize money the other day."</sup></p>
<p id="L14">"Hey, leader. I need a new wand too!"<br><sup>「ねぇ、リーダー。私も新しい杖が欲しいな～」</sup><br><sup>"My dear leader,"I want a new cane, too~"</sup></p>
<p id="L15"><br></p>
<p id="L16">The place was filled with young people who looked like they were just starting out as adventurers, as well as those who looked like seasoned adventurers.<br><sup>まだ冒険者なりたて風の若者から、いかにもベテランそうな風貌の者まで溢れている。</sup><br><sup>There are many young people who still look like adventurers, and there are many who look like veterans.</sup></p>
<p id="L17">I had only been involved with the fishermen, innkeepers, and diners, so I finally got to see the rest of the people.<br><sup>今まで漁師と宿屋と飯屋の連中ぐらいしか関わってなかったから、ようやくそれ以外の連中を見ることが出来た。</sup><br><sup>Until now, I had only been involved with fishermen, inns, and restaurants, so I could finally see the rest of them.</sup></p>
<p id="L18">And the conversations I heard were exactly like those of adventurers, which made me even more excited.<br><sup>そして、聞こえてくる会話がまさに冒険者たちのソレで、俺は余計にワクワクしてきた。</sup><br><sup>And the conversation I heard was just the adventurers' soles, and I was even more excited.</sup></p>
<p id="L19">What's more, the money for today's shopping is money I earned by working for myself.<br><sup>さらに、今日買い物するための金は、俺が自分で働いて稼いだ金だ。</sup><br><sup>What's more, the money to shop today is the money I earned from my own work.</sup></p>
<p id="L20">It's not that much, but it's not the allowance I used to get before I ran away from home, or the money I earned from Traina's War Go.<br><sup>そんなにあるわけではないけど、家出する前まで貰っていた小遣いや、トレイナの戦碁で稼いだ金でもない。</sup><br><sup>It's not that much, but it's not the allowance I got before I ran away from home or the money I earned from Trina's go game.</sup></p>
<p id="L21"><br></p>
<p id="L22">"Oh, ...... weapons are so ......... ......."<br><sup>「おぉ……武器があんなに……ん～……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh... the weapons are so... well..."</sup></p>
<p id="L23"><br></p>
<p id="L24">I walked into the store and the first thing I saw was the weapons section.<br><sup>店内に入り、まず目に入ったのは武器コーナーだな。</sup><br><sup>The first thing I saw when I entered the store was the weapons section.</sup></p>
<p id="L25">There are swords of various shapes, spears, axes, bows and arrows ...... but ......<br><sup>形状様々な剣を始め、槍、斧、弓矢……だけど……</sup><br><sup>Shape: Starting with various swords, spears, axes, bow and arrow... but...</sup></p>
<p id="L26"><br></p>
<p id="L27">"...... something ...... doesn't look like much of anything."<br><sup>「……なんか……あんまり大したものは無さそうだな」</sup><br><sup>"...I don't think there's much to it."</sup></p>
<p id="L28"><br></p>
<p id="L29">Weapons are exciting to look at, and I was excited to head to the weapons section, but upon closer inspection, it dawned on me that they didn't look like very good steel, nor were they well-trained.<br><sup>武器ってのは見ているだけでワクワクするもので、俺もワクワクして武器コーナーに向かったが、よくよく見てみると、それほど良い鉄にも見えないし、鍛えられているわけでもないというのが、俺にも分かった。</sup><br><sup>Arms were exciting just to look at them, and I was excited to head to the weapons section, but when I looked closely, I found out that they didn't look that good or trained.</sup></p>
<p id="L30">If it's something like that, go to ......<br><sup>なんかアレなら……</sup><br><sup>If it's not like that...</sup></p>
<p id="L31"><br></p>
<p id="L32">"There's usually a lot more good stuff in my home armory. ......"<br><sup>「俺の家の武器庫の方が、普通に良いモノがたくさんあるな……」</sup><br><sup>"There are usually more good things in my arsenal..."</sup></p>
<p id="L33"><br></p>
<p id="L34">The weapons in the mansion that my dad and mom had collected were much more varied, and there were many that I could tell were powerful weapons just by looking at them.<br><sup>親父と母さんが集めた屋敷の武器の方がもっと種類が豊富で、見ただけで強力な武器だと分かるものが沢山あった。</sup><br><sup>There were more kinds of weapons in the house collected by my father and mother, and there were many that could be recognized as powerful weapons just by looking at them.</sup></p>
<p id="L35">Compared to that, a quick look at ...... doesn't show that much of anything.<br><sup>それに比べたら、ザッと見た感じそんな大したものは……</sup><br><sup>Compared to that, it feels like I've taken a quick look at it.That's not much...</sup></p>
<p id="L36"><br></p>
<p id="L37">"Of course.<br><sup>『当たり前だ』</sup><br><sup>"Of course,"</sup></p>
<p id="L38">"Traina?"<br><sup>「トレイナ？」</sup><br><sup>"Trainer?"</sup></p>
<p id="L39">I'm not sure what to say. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what's going on in your life and what you can do to help.<br><sup>『貴様の父と母は七勇者だ。それこそ、地上の古今東西から魔界にも名が轟くような名刀や伝説の武器を所持しているだろう……その辺の有象無象のハンターが集うような道具屋に、それほどのものを期待するな』</sup><br><sup>"Your father and mother are the Seven Braves.That's what you're going to have, from all over the world, from all over the world, from all over the world, from swords and legendary weapons... don't expect so much from a tool store where imaginary hunters gather."</sup></p>
<p id="L40">"Oh~...... is that so?"<br><sup>「あ～……そうなのか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh... really?"</sup></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42">What's ......, if you ask me.<br><sup>なんだ……って、言われてみればそうか。</sup><br><sup>Now that you say what... I see.</sup></p>
<p id="L43"><br></p>
<p id="L44"><br></p>
<p id="L45">"That's right ...... I was wondering if there was anything like Excalibur, Gungnir, or Balmunk ......."<br><sup>「そりゃそうか……エクスカリバーとかグングニルとかバルムンクとか、そういうのはないかなって思ったんだけど……」</sup><br><sup>"I see... I thought there was anything like Excalibur, Gunnil, Balmunk..."</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">"Of course not!<br><sup>『あるわけなかろう！』</sup><br><sup>'I don't think so!'</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">"It's a joke, a joke. No matter how naive I am, I know that there is no way that such a legendary weapon that you only hear about in fairy tales can be found here.<br><sup>「はは、流石に冗談だよ冗談。いくら俺が世間知らずだからって、そんなおとぎ話でしか聞かない伝説の武器がこんな所にあるわけねーって分かってるよ」</sup><br><sup>"Haha, it's a joke.No matter how naive I am, I know there's no legendary weapon here that I only hear in such fairy tales."</sup></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51">It's no wonder. In the first place, Excalibur was broken by me in a battle a few hundred years ago, and Gungnir is in the possession of the father of the seven heroic soldiers,......, the princess of the empire. In the event that you are not able to find a private room that you used when you wanted to be alone in the past, you can find it there.<br><sup>『当たり前だ。そもそも、エクスカリバーは数百年前の戦いで余がへし折ったし、グングニルは七勇者のソルジャ……あの帝国の姫の父親が持っている。あ、しかしバルムンクなら余のコレクションだったので……余が昔、一人になりたかった時に使っていたプライベートルームが見つかっていなければ、そこにあるはずだぞ！』</sup><br><sup>'Of course, Excalibur was destroyed in the battle hundreds of years ago, and Gunnil was owned by the seven brave Solja... the father of the princess of the Empire.Oh, but Balmunk was a collection of other things... if you haven't found the private room you used to use when you wanted to be alone in the past, it should be there!"</sup></p>
<p id="L52"><br></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54">...... Hmm~?　I had to look twice at Traina when she said something amazing.<br><sup>……ん～？　なんかスゴイことを言われてトレイナを二度見してしまった。</sup><br><sup>...huh? I saw Trina twice when she said something amazing.</sup></p>
<p id="L55">What?　It's a real weapon?　I'm sure you've heard of it, but I'm not sure if you've heard of it. ......<br><sup>え？　実在する武器なの？！　あっ、そういえばこいつはカンティーダンで伝説の刀・コテツもへし折ったとかなんかサラッと言ってたような……</sup><br><sup>What? Is it a real weapon?!Come to think of it, this is Kantidan, and it seems like he said he broke the legendary sword and iron...</sup></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">"Well, what do I care about weapons? Your fighting style doesn't require weapons in the first place. Your fighting style doesn't require any weapons, and the fight with the Parisian the other day was special.<br><sup>『まぁ、武器についてはどうでもよいではないか。そもそも貴様の戦闘スタイルは武器を必要としない。この間のパリピとの戦いは特別だっただけだ』</sup><br><sup>'Well, I don't care about weapons.Your fighting style doesn't require weapons in the first place.The other day's battle against Parisi was just special."</sup></p>
<p id="L58">"Well, yes, but ...... it's kind of a rambling ......."<br><sup>「まぁ、そうだけど……なんつーか、浪漫というか……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's right, but... it's kind of romantic..."</sup></p>
<p id="L59">"I'd rather you had a ...... hmm ...... than a weapon. Oh, that!<br><sup>『むしろ貴様には武器よりも……ふむ……おお、あれは！』</sup><br><sup>'Rather than weapons to you... well... oh, that!'</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">Treyna looked around the weapons section and suddenly her eyes lit up as she stared at one place.<br><sup>トレイナがザッと武器コーナーを見渡して、ふと一か所を見つめて眼を輝かせた。</sup><br><sup>Trina glanced around the weapons corner and glistened at one place.</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63">"There's always something better!　You should try the nostalgic ...... children's multi-tool knife there.<br><sup>『よいものがちゃんとあるではないか！　懐かしい……童、そこの『マルチツールナイフ』にしておけ』</sup><br><sup>"You have something good, don't you?"I miss it... Child, make it a 'multi-tool knife' over there."</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">What an excited Traina offered me was a knife.<br><sup>興奮気味のトレイナが俺に勧めてきたのは、なんとナイフだった。</sup><br><sup>What Trina, who was a little excited, recommended to me was a knife.</sup></p>
<p id="L66">I followed the gaze to see what it was all about. ...... There wasn't much of a crowd, but there was a box on the floor, and when I looked inside, I saw a lot of small handle-like objects.<br><sup>それは一体どんなものかと俺はその視線を追うと……そこだけはそれほど人だかりもできておらず、そんな所に一つの箱が置いてあり、中を覗くと小さな柄のようなものが大量に入っていた。</sup><br><sup>I followed his gaze to see what it was like... there was not much crowd there, and there was a box in it, and when I looked inside, there was a large amount of something like a small handle.</sup></p>
<p id="L67">Not popular and unsold?　It's like no one is buying it?<br><sup>人気が無くて売れ残っている？　誰も買ってないようなもの？</sup><br><sup>Is it unsold because it's not popular?Like no one bought it?</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">"What?　The knife ...... this?　Isn't that just the handle?"<br><sup>「え？　ナイフ……これ？　柄だけじゃないのか？」</sup><br><sup>"What? Knife... this?Isn't it just the handle?"</sup></p>
<p id="L70">"It's foldable. Try pulling on the groove.<br><sup>『それは折り畳み式だ。溝の部分を引っ張ってみるがよい』</sup><br><sup>"It is foldable.Try pulling at the groove.'</sup></p>
<p id="L71">"Oh, oh, there it is: ...... little ......."<br><sup>「お、おお、出た……ちっさ……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, oh, it's out... a little..."</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">It was a folding type, and I took out the blade, which was much smaller than the knives ...... that hunters would use as weapons.<br><sup>折り畳み式とのことで、刃を出してみたのだが、それはハンターたちが武器として使用するようなナイフ……よりも遥かに小さい。</sup><br><sup>I heard it was foldable, so I put out the blade, but it was much smaller than a knife that hunters use as a weapon.</sup></p>
<p id="L74">It was much smaller than the kunai that Shinobu was holding.<br><sup>シノブが持っていたクナイよりもずっと小さい。</sup><br><sup>It's much smaller than Sinob had.</sup></p>
<p id="L75">You can only do a little damage when you fight a monster or something with this thing.<br><sup>こんなのでモンスターとかと戦ってもちょっとしかダメージ与えられねえぞ？</sup><br><sup>Because of this, even if you fight monsters, you'll only get a little damage.</sup></p>
<p id="L76">I mean, I can only imagine the sight of the knife breaking if I stab it into Mr. Machou's abdominal muscles.<br><sup>っていうか、マチョウさんの腹筋に刺したらナイフがへし折れる光景しか想像できない。</sup><br><sup>I mean, I can only imagine the scene where a knife would break if it stuck in Matthew's abs.</sup></p>
<p id="L77">But Traina's smile never changed.<br><sup>しかし、トレイナの笑みは変わらない。</sup><br><sup>But Trina's smile remains the same.</sup></p>
<p id="L78"><br></p>
<p id="L79">"Hmm. You don't understand. It's not meant for combat, it has a variety of functions for use in the field.<br><sup>『ふふん。分かっていないな。それは戦闘用ではなく、野外生活において使用する様々な機能が備わっているのだ』</sup><br><sup>"Well, I don't understand.It's not for combat, it's got a lot of functions to use in outdoor life.'</sup></p>
<p id="L80">"...... what?"<br><sup>「……なに？」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L81">"Try pulling something other than a knife.<br><sup>『ナイフ以外のものを引っ張ってみろ』</sup><br><sup>"Pull something other than a knife."</sup></p>
<p id="L82">"The other ...... what?　It can be a file, a spoon or even a fork. ...... It even has scissors!　It's so convenient!<br><sup>「他の……あれ？　ヤスリになったり、スプーンとかフォークまで……ハサミまで付いてる！？　すっげ、こりゃ便利じゃねーか！」</sup><br><sup>"Other... Huh?It's like a file, spoons, forks...It even comes with scissors!?It's very convenient, isn't it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">I thought it was a knife, but that wasn't the only function that was folded up.<br><sup>ナイフかと思えば、折りたたまれていた機能はそれだけじゃなかった。</sup><br><sup>When I thought of it as a knife, that was not the only function that had been folded.</sup></p>
<p id="L85">When I was surprised to see the item for the first time, Traina looked smug and said ......<br><sup>初めて見たアイテムに俺が驚くと、トレイナはドヤ顔で……</sup><br><sup>When I was surprised by the first item I saw, Trina looked dazed...</sup></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">It's a multi-tool knife,......, also known as the Magical Survival Knife. It's a good idea to use a multi-tool knife,......, also known as a "magical survival knife".<br><sup>『ふっふっふ、それはかつて余が考案したものでな……魔王軍の兵には必需品として必ず携帯させていたものだ。マルチツールナイフ……別名では、『マジカルサバイバルナイフ』と呼ばれていたのだ』</sup><br><sup>'Huff, that was once invented by us...It was a must-have item for the soldiers of the demon army.Multi-tool knife... It was called the Magical Survival Knife."</sup></p>
<p id="L88">"Wow, ...... was your idea!"<br><sup>「へぇ～……って、あんたが考えたのか！？」</sup><br><sup>"Did you think that...?"</sup></p>
<p id="L89">"I guess the war is over and the culture of the demon world is about to be adopted by the earth. ...... But ......<br><sup>『戦争が終わり、魔界の文化も地上に取り入れようとしているのだろうな……しかし……』</sup><br><sup>'The war is over, and the culture of the magical world is about to be introduced to the earth... but...'</sup></p>
<p id="L90"><br></p>
<p id="L91">And you're the inventor!　But it's certainly useful enough to make me look smug.<br><sup>って、考案者かよ！？　でも、ドヤ顔してもいいぐらい確かにこれは便利だ。</sup><br><sup>Are you the inventor!?But this is certainly convenient enough to look like a fool.</sup></p>
<p id="L92">It's not heavy at all, it fits in your pocket, and yet it has many uses.<br><sup>全然重くないし、ポケットに入るし、それでいて用途は様々だ。</sup><br><sup>It's not heavy at all, it fits in my pocket, and it's still versatile.</sup></p>
<p id="L93">I mean, this is certainly a necessity, isn't it?<br><sup>むしろこれは確かに必需品じゃねえのか？</sup><br><sup>Rather, isn't this a necessity?</sup></p>
<p id="L94">And Traina wondered about that a little too: ......<br><sup>そして、トレイナもそれを少し疑問に思ったのか……</sup><br><sup>And did Trina question it a little?"</sup></p>
<p id="L95"><br></p>
<p id="L96">But why is there such a surplus?　I think it would be a good idea to sell a lot of them. ...... And it also says "big discount"!<br><sup>『しかし、何故こんなに余っている？　売れまくってもおかしくないと思うのだが……しかも大特価とも書かれているではないか！』</sup><br><sup>'But why are there so many left over?'I don't think it's strange to sell too much... and it's also written as a bargain!'</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">Yeah, that's what I thought, too.<br><sup>そう、俺もそう思っていた。</sup><br><sup>Yes, I thought so, too.</sup></p>
<p id="L99">If it's this useful, it wouldn't hurt to have one for every swordsman, spearman, wizard, or whatever type of adventurer you are.<br><sup>こんな便利なものなら、剣士とか槍使いとか、魔法使いとか、職種が何であろうと冒険するなら一人一つは持ってて全然損しないだろ。</sup><br><sup>With such a convenient thing, if you venture with swordsmen, spearsmen, wizards, whatever occupation you have, you won't lose at all.</sup></p>
<p id="L100">So why not ......<br><sup>それなのに何で……</sup><br><sup>But why...</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">"Oh, look, there's a young adventurer..."<br><sup>「お、な～んか、若い冒険者がいるな～」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, there's a young adventurer~"</sup></p>
<p id="L103">"Oh, you're so cute. I'm an apprentice, aren't I?"<br><sup>「あら、かわいい。うふふふ、ぼくは見習いなの？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that's cute. Hmmm, am I an apprentice?"</sup></p>
<p id="L104">"Hmm?　That knife ...... ah ......"<br><sup>「おや？　そのナイフ……あ～……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh? That knife... oh..."</sup></p>
<p id="L105"><br></p>
<p id="L106">From behind me, a group of people who looked like some adventuring party started talking to me.<br><sup>そんな俺の後ろから、どこかの冒険者パーティーと思われる連中が俺に話しかけてきた。</sup><br><sup>Behind me, people who seemed to be adventurers talked to me.</sup></p>
<p id="L107">No matter how young some of them are, it's probably rare to find one as young as me at 15.<br><sup>いくら若い奴らも居るとはいえ、１５の俺ぐらい若いのは珍しいのかもしれないな。</sup><br><sup>No matter how young they are, it may be rare for them to be as young as I am when I am fifteen.</sup></p>
<p id="L108">Then they saw the knife I had in my hand, and they laughed and ......<br><sup>すると、俺が手に持っていたナイフを見て連中は苦笑して……</sup><br><sup>Then they laughed bitterly at the knife I was holding in my hand...</sup></p>
<p id="L109"><br></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111">"You're too young to know this, but it's not good for your ...... image if you carry that knife around too much, you know?　Well, some people do use them."<br><sup>「君は若いから知らないだろうけど、あんまりそのナイフ持ってると……イメージ良くないぞ？　まぁ、使ってるやつも居なくもないけどな」</sup><br><sup>"You don't know because you're young, but if you have that knife too much... it's not a good image, is it?Well, there's no one who uses it."</sup></p>
<p id="L112"><br></p>
<p id="L113">"...... huh?"<br><sup>「……え？」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115">"It was once used by the demon king's army,......, and for those who know more than a little bit about the past,......, the image of the demon king's army is very similar to the image of the demon king's army. You know what I mean?　I'm not sure what to make of it.<br><sup>「それはな～、かつて魔王軍の連中が使ってたものでな……そのな……多少なりとも昔を知っている連中からすれば……イメージがな？　まぁ、戦争を知らない若い世代はこれから知らずに使っていくのかもしれねーけど、まだな？」</sup><br><sup>"That's what the Devil's Army used to use... you know... from the perspective of those who know more or less the old days... image?Well, the younger generation who don't know the war may use it without knowing it, but not yet?"</sup></p>
<p id="L116"><br></p>
<p id="L117"><br></p>
<p id="L118">Just from the look on her face and the words she had said up to that point, both Traina and I understood everything.<br><sup>その表情とそれまでの言葉だけで、俺もトレイナも全てを理解した。</sup><br><sup>With just that expression and the words so far, both me and Trina understood everything.</sup></p>
<p id="L119">In other words, I don't feel good about using the same thing that the Demon King's army used.<br><sup>ようするに、魔王軍の連中が使っていたのと同じものを使うのは、なんとなく気分が良くないってことなんだ。</sup><br><sup>In short, it's kind of unpleasant to use the same thing that the demons used.</sup></p>
<p id="L120">I was not even born at the time, but if I had been born then, or if I had been a veteran, I would have fought in the war.<br><sup>当時生まれてもいなかった俺ならまだしも、当時生まれていた連中だったり、ましてやベテランなら戦争で戦ってたかもしれねえ。</sup><br><sup>If I hadn't been born at that time, if I were born at that time, or if I were a veteran, I might have fought in the war.</sup></p>
<p id="L121">From the point of view of such people, even though the war is over, the things used by the Demon King's army are still ...... ah, such ......<br><sup>そんな連中からすれば、たとえ戦争が終わったとはいえ、魔王軍の使ってたものは……あ～、そういう……</sup><br><sup>For them, even if the war is over, what the demon army used to use... oh, that's it...</sup></p>
<p id="L122"><br></p>
<p id="L123"><br></p>
<p id="L124">"Damn, all these adventurers and hunters whose names are synonymous with freedom, and now they're all tied up in these weird things. ...... Sorry to hear that."<br><sup>「けっ、自由が代名詞と言われている冒険者やハンターたちが、変なものに縛られてやがるな……お気の毒に」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, I'm sorry that adventurers and hunters, who are said to be synonymous with freedom, are bound by strange things."</sup></p>
<p id="L125"><br></p>
<p id="L126"><br></p>
<p id="L127">I was just saying what I thought.<br><sup>俺は思ったことをそのまま口に出していた。</sup><br><sup>I was just saying what I thought.</sup></p>
<p id="L128"><br></p>
<p id="L129">"Hey, you?"<br><sup>「おい、君？」</sup><br><sup>"Hey, my dear?"</sup></p>
<p id="L130">"I don't care, so I'm buying."<br><sup>「俺は気にならないから買う」</sup><br><sup>"I don't care, so I'll buy it."</sup></p>
<p id="L131">"Oh, hey!"<br><sup>「あ、お、おい！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my God!"</sup></p>
<p id="L132">"You may have the worst image of humanity, but you're the best in the world to me."<br><sup>「人類のイメージが最悪でも、俺からの印象は世界一だからよ♪」</sup><br><sup>"Even if the image of mankind is the worst, my impression is the best in the world♪"</sup></p>
<p id="L133"><br></p>
<p id="L134">This is such a convenient, inexpensive and versatile item ...... that it would be a shame not to possess it because of the eyes around you.<br><sup>こんな便利で安い万能なアイテム……周りの目を気にして所持しないなんて、もったいねー。</sup><br><sup>Such a convenient and cheap all-purpose item... It's a waste not to carry it out of concern for the eyes around you.</sup></p>
<p id="L135">Well, of course, I don't know how these guys feel.<br><sup>まぁ、もちろんこいつらの気持ちも分からないでもない。</sup><br><sup>Well, of course I don't understand how they feel.</sup></p>
<p id="L136">Some of them may have had the misfortune of having their families killed by the Demon Lord's army who had this.<br><sup>中にはこれを持っていた魔王軍に家族を殺されたりとか、不幸な目にあったやつらも居るだろう。</sup><br><sup>Some of them may have had misfortune, such as killing their families by the demon army who had this.</sup></p>
<p id="L137">So I don't understand why they don't want to use it, or why people might not think well of them.<br><sup>だから、「使いたくない」、「周りから良く思われないかもしれない」という奴らの気持ちも分からなくもない。</sup><br><sup>Therefore, I don't understand their feelings of "I don't want to use it" and "I might not like it from people around me."</sup></p>
<p id="L138">But from my point of view, it's a small thing.<br><sup>だが、俺からすればそんなもん小さなことだ。</sup><br><sup>But that's a small thing for me.</sup></p>
<p id="L139">I mean, it's a little late for that.<br><sup>っていうか、今更だしな。</sup><br><sup>I mean, it's too late.</sup></p>
<p id="L140"><br></p>
<p id="L141">"Well, ...... Traina, what else would you like?"<br><sup>「さて……トレイナ、他は何が良い？」</sup><br><sup>"Well... Trina, what else would you like?"</sup></p>
<p id="L142">"..............." "......<br><sup>『……………ふっ……』</sup><br><sup>"……………………………………………………………………………………"</sup></p>
<p id="L143">"Traina?"<br><sup>「トレイナ？」</sup><br><sup>"Trainer?"</sup></p>
<p id="L144">"Mm......mm, so portable food and medicinal herbs are next!<br><sup>『うむ……うむ、では次は携帯食や薬草類だな！』</sup><br><sup>'Well... well, next is portable food and herbs!'</sup></p>
<p id="L145"><br></p>
<p id="L146">I thought Traina was kind of smiling happily at me, but ...... well, I'm not going to mention it.<br><sup>トレイナが何だか俺を見て嬉しそうに微笑んでいた気がしたけど……まぁ、触れないでおくか。</sup><br><sup>I felt like Trina was smiling happily at me... well, let's not touch it.</sup></p>
<p id="L147">With that decision made, I turned to the next corner.<br><sup>そう決めて、俺は次のコーナーへと足を向けた。</sup><br><sup>So I decided to move on to the next corner.</sup></p>
