<p id="L1">I was outsmarted by my own son.<br><sup>自分の息子に出し抜かれた。</sup><br><sup>I was overtaken by my son.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">It didn't happen by accident, by chance, or on the spur of the moment.<br><sup>マグレやその場の行き当たりばったりで偶然になったわけではない。</sup><br><sup>It wasn't a coincidence that Magre or a casual occurrence.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">Obviously, we were entangled in a scheme.<br><sup>明らかに私たちは策で絡め取られた。</sup><br><sup>Obviously we were entangled in a plot.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">The children of Cakretail told me that Earth had defeated Yamidire.<br><sup>カクレテールの子たちが、アースはヤミディレに勝ったと言っていた。</sup><br><sup>The children of Cacletale said that Earth had defeated Yamidile.</sup></p>
<p id="L5">If you can even put up a plan to get the better of both me and Hiiro, then you may indeed be right.<br><sup>私とヒイロの二人を手玉に取る策すら張れるのならば、確かにそうなのかもしれない。</sup><br><sup>If he could even take advantage of me and Hiro, that might be true.</sup></p>
<p id="L6">But still, that move that made us both fall on our asses. It was all because he had the strength to do that.<br><sup>でも、やはりそれでも私たち二人を尻餅つかせたあの動き。全てはあれができるだけの力があってこそ。</sup><br><sup>But still, that movement that made both of us fall on our hips.It's all about having the strength to do that.</sup></p>
<p id="L7">Earth has grown stronger. It's bigger. And it has yet to show us the bottom of it.<br><sup>アースは強くなった。大きくなった。そしてその底をまだ私たちには見せてくれない。</sup><br><sup>The earth became stronger.It's grown up. And they haven't shown us the bottom yet.</sup></p>
<p id="L8">In any case, ......<br><sup>いずれにせよ……</sup><br><sup>Anyway...</sup></p>
<p id="L9"><br></p>
<p id="L10">"No, no, no, no, no!"<br><sup>「ぬおおおおおおおお！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my God!"</sup></p>
<p id="L11">"Oh, my God!<br><sup>「でりゃああああああ！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my God!"</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">We, a couple of idiots, can't take any other option but to chase.<br><sup>私たちバカ夫婦は追いかける以外の選択肢を取るわけにはいかない。</sup><br><sup>We fools have no choice but to pursue.</sup></p>
<p id="L14">First, get off the deserted island as quickly as possible and swim ...... to the other shore.<br><sup>まずは、無人島からさっさと出て、向こうの岸まで……泳ぐ。</sup><br><sup>First of all, get out of the desert island quickly and swim to the shore over there.</sup></p>

<p id="L20">On the way there, we almost ran into a giant fish that tried to swallow us, but we kicked it all away.<br><sup>その途中で私たちを飲み込もうとする巨大魚と遭遇しそうになったけど、全部蹴散らす。</sup><br><sup>On the way, we almost meet a giant fish trying to swallow us, but we kick them all away.</sup></p>

<p id="L22">"All right, Ma'am!　We're almost to the shores of Betrayal!"<br><sup>「よっし、マアム！　もう少しで、ベトレイアルの岸に辿り着くぞ！」</sup><br><sup>"All right, Maam! We're almost there!"</sup></p>
<p id="L23">"Yeah, last spurt!　Watch me, even though I'm a little out of practice and so pathetic that my son rolls me over, I'm not so old that I can't swim!　I'm seventeen forever!"<br><sup>「ええ、ラストスパートよ！　見てなさいよ、たとえ実戦から少し離れて息子に転ばされるほど情けなくなろうとも、泳げなくなるほど老いちゃいないんだから！　私は永遠の１７歳！」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, it's the last spurt!"Look, even if you feel pathetic enough to be knocked down by your son a little away from the actual battle, you won't be old enough to swim!I'm 17 forever!"</sup></p>
<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25">My son rejected me, outsmarted me, and went straight back in front of me.<br><sup>息子に拒否されて、出し抜かれて、そのまま目の前でまた行ってしまった。</sup><br><sup>He was rejected by his son, outwitted, and left in front of him again.</sup></p>
<p id="L26">But we're not going to let that stop us from going home.<br><sup>だけれど、これぐらいでへこたれて家に帰る私たちじゃないわ。</sup><br><sup>But we're not going home exhausted by this much.</sup></p>
<p id="L27">Together, the two of us dogpiled nonstop as we made our way to the other shore. ......<br><sup>二人そろってノンストップで犬かきしながら、私たちは向こうの岸へと……</sup><br><sup>We were both scratching our dogs nonstop to the shore over there...</sup></p>

<p id="L33"><br></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35">But then it happened.<br><sup>でも、その時だった。</sup><br><sup>But it was then.</sup></p>
<p id="L36"><br></p>
<p id="L37">"...... huh?"<br><sup>「……え？」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L38">"What about ......?　What?　What?<br><sup>「……は？　え？　なっ？」</sup><br><sup>"...what? What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">I heard a voice above us, mocking us for the ridiculousness of our current situation.<br><sup>今の私たちを滑稽だと嘲笑う声が、私たちの上から聞こえた。</sup><br><sup>We heard voices laughing at us for being ridiculous.</sup></p>
<p id="L41">Up there?　There's ocean all around here, okay?　From up there at ......? !<br><sup>上？　ここは辺り一面が海よ？　上から……？！</sup><br><sup>Above? This is the sea all over?From above...?!</sup></p>
<p id="L42">When Hiiro and I looked up at the same time, there it was: ......<br><sup>私とヒイロが同時に顔を上げると、そこには……</sup><br><sup>When Hiro and I looked up at the same time, there was...</sup></p>
<p id="L43"><br></p>

<p id="L45">"Wait, you're ......."<br><sup>「ちょ、あんたは……」</sup><br><sup>"Hey, you..."</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">There was a woman with a long white coat and long brown hair pulled back, floating around.<br><sup>そこには真っ白いロングコートを羽織った、長い茶色い髪を後ろにまとめた女がプカプカと浮いていた。</sup><br><sup>There was a woman in a long white coat with long brown hair tied back.</sup></p>
<p id="L48">We know the woman.<br><sup>私たちはその女を知っている。</sup><br><sup>We know that woman.</sup></p>
<p id="L49">They are much more mature than we knew them, and their bodies have grown a lot.<br><sup>私たちが知っている頃よりもずっと大人びて、体も大きく成長している。</sup><br><sup>He is much more mature and grown up than we knew.</sup></p>
<p id="L50">But that face, and more importantly, that ribbon, though a little worn, that she had cherished since "the time we were together".<br><sup>だけれども、あの面影、そして何よりも少しくたびれてはいるものの「私たちと一緒に居た頃」から大切にしていた、あのリボン。</sup><br><sup>But that figure, and above all, the ribbon that I cherished since "when you were with us," although a little tired.</sup></p>
<p id="L51"><br></p>
<p id="L52">"You ...... Espy?<br><sup>「お前……エスピッ！？」</sup><br><sup>"You... Espit!"</sup></p>
<p id="L53">"Oh, no. ...... Espy!　It's not Espy!　Oh, my God, why are you here?　What are you doing here? No, where have you been?<br><sup>「ちょ、うそ……エスピ！　エスピじゃないの！　あ、あんたどうして？　こんな所で何を、いえ、今までどこに？！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, no... Espi! Isn't it Espi?! Oh, why are you?What are you doing here, no, where have you been?"</sup></p>
<p id="L54"><br></p>
<p id="L55">They are friends who once fought against the Demon King's army led by the Great Demon King, entrusting their lives and souls to each other.<br><sup>かつて共に命と魂を預け合って、あの大魔王率いる魔王軍と戦った仲間。</sup><br><sup>He once trusted his life and soul together and fought against the demon army led by the demon king.</sup></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">"Hi, there. Heero ...... Ma'am ...... something ...... stupid."<br><sup>「おひさ。ヒイロ……マアム……なんだか……バカみたい」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my God. Hi... Maam... It's kind of...You're a fool."</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">At the time, I was still a child of less than ten, but I had the same title as Hiiro and I, Seven Brave Men, and I was a hero who made a name for myself in the world with my many battles.<br><sup>当時はまだ十にも満たない子供だったのに、私とヒイロと同じ七勇者の肩書を持ち、数多の戦果を挙げて世界に名を轟かせた英雄。</sup><br><sup>At that time, he was still less than ten children, but he was a hero who made his mark all over the world with the same title as Hiro and I.</sup></p>
<p id="L60">But ......<br><sup>でも……</sup><br><sup>But...</sup></p>
<p id="L61"><br></p>
<p id="L62">"Oh, where the hell have you been?　You've disappeared from the Betrayal Kingdom. ...... Mikado's Zee said she doesn't know where you are. ......"<br><sup>「お、お前、今までどこに居たんだ！　ベトレイアル王国から姿を消したって……ミカドのジーさんもお前の行方だけは分からないって……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, where have you been so far?"He disappeared from the Kingdom of Bethleial...

<p id="L63">"Yes, you should explain it to me. ...... But, oh, my God!<br><sup>「そうよ、ちゃんと説明しなさ……あ～、でも、あ～～～、んもう！」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, explain it properly... oh, but oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">There are a lot of things to ask this girl,......, but both Hiiro and I had other things on our minds at the same time.<br><sup>この<ruby><rb>娘</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>こ</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>には聞かなきゃいけないことが山ほどある……と思ったものの、私もヒイロも同時に別のことが頭を過った。</sup><br><sup>I thought this girl had a lot to ask... but at the same time I and Hiro went off the deep end of the wrong way.</sup></p>
<p id="L66">It should be a priority at all costs. ......<br><sup>それは、本来なら何をおいても優先しなければならない……</sup><br><sup>That's supposed to take precedence over everything...</sup></p>
<p id="L67"><br></p>
<p id="L68">"It's ......, Espy. I have no idea what's going on, what you're thinking, or what you've been up to, but I'm sorry!　Now we're in a hurry!"<br><sup>「くそ……だけど、エスピ。何があって、何を考えてるか、今まで何をやってたか全然分からねーけど、すまねえ！　今、俺たちは急いでるんだ！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh... but Espi.I don't know what's going on, what's on my mind, what's on my mind, what's on my mind, but I'm sorry!We're in a hurry right now!"</sup></p>
<p id="L69">"Yeah!　Do you remember him?　Our son, Earth. You held him in your arms when he was a baby.　Now he's running away from home ...... and he's working with Yamidire!<br><sup>「ええ！　あんたも覚えてる？　私たちの息子、アースを。赤ちゃんの時に抱っこしてくれたでしょ？　あの子が今、家出中で……しかも、今はヤミディレと行動してるっていうのよ！」</sup><br><sup>"Yes! Do you remember our son, Earth?"You hugged me when I was a baby, right?She's running away from home... and she's acting with a yamidire now!"</sup></p>
<p id="L70">"Espy, use your 'ability' to get us to shore!"<br><sup>「エスピ、お前の『能力』で俺らを岸まで送ってくれ！」</sup><br><sup>"Espi, send us ashore with your 'competence!'"</sup></p>
<p id="L71">"And if possible, we'd like you to carry us as well!"<br><sup>「んで、できれば私たちもそのまま運んでほしいの！」</sup><br><sup>"Why, if possible, we'd like you to carry it as it is!"</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">Yes, Earth.<br><sup>そう、アースよ。</sup><br><sup>Yeah, it's Earth.</sup></p>
<p id="L74">Espy also went missing and has not been seen in years. My precious friend. I've been looking for him for a long time. I know that.<br><sup>エスピもまた行方不明となって数年ぶりの再会。大切な仲間。ずっと探していた。それは分かっている。</sup><br><sup>Espi was also missing and reunited after several years.My precious companion.

<p id="L75">But now we're at ......<br><sup>でも今の私たちは……</sup><br><sup>But now we're...</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77"><br></p>
<p id="L78">"I know.<br><sup>「知ってるよ～」</sup><br><sup>"I know~"</sup></p>
<p id="L79"><br></p>
<p id="L80">"...... huh?"<br><sup>「「……え？」」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">"I went to Kakretele to talk to them a little bit. ......<br><sup>「カクレテールでちょこっとお話を聞いて来たから……」</sup><br><sup>"I've heard a little from you in Kakretail..."</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">"What?"<br><sup>「「ッッ！？」」</sup><br><sup>"'Huh!'"</sup></p>
<p id="L85"><br></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">Espy uttered something unexpected. Does Espy know about the ...... series of events?<br><sup>意外なことをエスピは口にした。エスピは……一連の流れを知っている？</sup><br><sup>Espi said something unexpected.Does Espi... know a series of trends?</sup></p>
<p id="L88"><br></p>
<p id="L89"><br></p>
<p id="L90">"I hear there's a scumbag on the loose who makes my sister cry?<br><sup>「妹を泣かせる最低男が、どうやら逃げ回っているそうだね？」</sup><br><sup>"The worst man who makes my sister cry seems to be running around, isn't he?"</sup></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">"......?　...... eh?"<br><sup>「「……へ？　……え？」」</sup><br><sup>"'...he?...what?'"</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94"><br></p>
<p id="L95">My sister ......?　Don't tell me Espy is referring to that Amae?<br><sup>妹……？　まさか、エスピはあのアマエのことを言ってるの？</sup><br><sup>Sister...? No way, is Espi talking about that Amae?</sup></p>
<p id="L96">What?　Why?<br><sup>え？　なんで？</sup><br><sup>What? Why?</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">"Hmmm, don't you know?　Don't you know that I'm ...... not a fan of men who make my sister cry?<br><sup>「ふふふ、知らないのぉ？　私が……妹を泣かせる男をユルサナイってことを」</sup><br><sup>"You don't know, do you?"I... the man who makes my sister cry is Yulsanai."</sup></p>
<p id="L99"><br></p>
<p id="L100">At that moment, something miserable overflows from Espy, who smiles smugly.<br><sup>そのとき、ニッコリと微笑むエスピからは、禍々しい何かが溢れ出ている。</sup><br><sup>At that time, something sinister overflowed from Espi, who smiled brightly.</sup></p>
<p id="L101">No. What?　You wouldn't allow a man to make your sister cry?　...... Was she like that?<br><sup>いや、え？　妹を泣かせる男を許さない？　……そんな子だったっけ？</sup><br><sup>No, what? Don't you forgive a man who makes my sister cry?... Was he like that?</sup></p>
<p id="L102"><br></p>
<p id="L103">"...... Heero?"<br><sup>「……ヒイロ？」</sup><br><sup>"... Hiro?"</sup></p>
<p id="L104"><br></p>
<p id="L105">Yeah. Indeed, Espy was like a sister to us. Or rather, we thought of her more like a sister than a friend.<br><sup>うん。確かにエスピは私たちにとっては妹みたいなものだった。というか、仲間というより妹のように思っていた。</sup><br><sup>Yeah. Espi was definitely like a sister to us.I mean, I thought she was more like a sister than a companion.</sup></p>
<p id="L106">But I didn't know ...... that there was such a side to Espy. ...... But I didn't know ...... that Espy had a brother or something like that, so... I don't know if there was any kind of feud between them... ......<br><sup>でも……そんな一面があったなんて……でも……エスピにとって兄とかそういうので……何か確執みたいなものがあったとかは……</sup><br><sup>But... I can't believe there was such an aspect... but... for Espi, there was something like a feud...</sup></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">"No, wait, wait!　I don't know anything about that, okay?　I don't know anything ...... related ......"<br><sup>「いや、待て待て！　俺は知らないぞ？　俺は、何も……関係……」</sup><br><sup>"No, wait!I don't know, do I?I don't have anything to do with... relationship..."</sup></p>
<p id="L109">"Yeah, right?"<br><sup>「だ、だよね？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, isn't it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L110">"Oh, oh ...... I have no idea ...... I should ......"<br><sup>「あ、ああ……心当たり……ない……はず……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, oh... I don't know... I'm sure..."</sup></p>
<p id="L111"><br></p>
<p id="L112">Hiiro also shakes his head quickly out of the water, looking impatient that he has no idea ...... but ......<br><sup>ヒイロも心当たりがないと焦った様子で海から出ている首を横に素早く振る……けど……</sup><br><sup>If Hiro doesn't know anything, he shakes his head quickly from the sea... but...</sup></p>
<p id="L113"><br></p>
<p id="L114">"Uh-huh. ......."<br><sup>「「う、う～ん……」」</sup><br><sup>"'Uh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh...'</sup></p>
<p id="L115"><br></p>
<p id="L116">Is there nothing wrong with us?　Such egotistical thinking was disappointed and rejected by my beloved son.<br><sup>自分たちには何も悪い所はない？　そんな自惚れた思考が愛する息子から失望され、そして拒絶された。</sup><br><sup>Is there anything wrong with us?Such conceited thinking was disappointed and rejected by my beloved son.</sup></p>
<p id="L117">That's why Hiiro couldn't easily assure me that he had no idea, and I felt subtle and tried to look back a bit hastily to the past.<br><sup>だからこそ、簡単に「心当たりはない」とヒイロも断言できず、私も微妙な気持ちになって、ちょっと昔を急いで振り返ってみようとした。</sup><br><sup>That's why Hiro couldn't easily say, "I don't have any idea," and I felt a little uneasy, so I hurried back to the past.</sup></p>
<p id="L118">But ......<br><sup>けれど……</sup><br><sup>But...</sup></p>
<p id="L119"><br></p>
<p id="L120"><br></p>
<p id="L121">"Hahaha, you're getting boring, Heero and Ma'am."<br><sup>「あははは、つまらなくなっちゃったね、ヒイロもマアムも」</sup><br><sup>"Hahaha, it's getting boring, Hiro and Maam,"</sup></p>
<p id="L122"><br></p>
<p id="L123">"Nuh-uh, ......?"<br><sup>「「ぬっ……？」」</sup><br><sup>"'What...?'"</sup></p>
<p id="L124"><br></p>
<p id="L125">"In the past, we didn't think, we acted before we thought, we did stupid things, and we still achieved great results. But now, you don't know anything about your own blood child. ...... And you're worried about it with your insufficient head. ...... You've lost your confidence... ...It's hard to imagine the two of you as you used to be."<br><sup>「昔は何も考えず、考える前に行動という考えでバカやって、それでも大きな戦果を挙げていた。なのに今では、自分の血の繋がった子供のことが何も分かってなくて……それで足りない頭で悩んで……自信が無くなっちゃってる……昔の二人からは考えられないね」</sup><br><sup>"In the past, I used to think nothing, and before I thought about it, I thought I was a fool, but I still achieved great results.But now I don't know anything about my blood-related child... so I'm worried about it because I don't have enough... I'm losing confidence...It's unthinkable from the two of us in the past."</sup></p>
<p id="L126"><br></p>
<p id="L127"><br></p>
<p id="L128">Espy laughs at us coldly, as if we are dumbfounded. As if he was disappointed in us.<br><sup>私たちを呆れたように冷たく笑うエスピ。私たちに失望しているかのように。</sup><br><sup>Espi laughs coldly at us.as if disappointed in us.</sup></p>
<p id="L129">She had always been a little kid, much younger than us, but her "upbringing" also made her a bit more mature, and there were times when she would laugh at our foolishness as if we were stupid.<br><sup>昔からあの子は、私たちよりもずっと幼いチビッ子だったけど、その「生い立ち」からもちょっと大人びているところもあったし、バカやる私たちを呆れたように笑う時もあった。</sup><br><sup>She's always been much younger than us, but she's grown up a little bit, and sometimes she laughs at us who are stupid.</sup></p>
<p id="L130">But to laugh so coldly like that... ......<br><sup>でも、あんなに冷たく笑うことは……</sup><br><sup>But it's hard to laugh so coldly...</sup></p>
<p id="L131"><br></p>
<p id="L132">"Have I changed?　Heero...... Ma'am......"<br><sup>「私、変わっちゃったかな？　ヒイロ……マアム……」</sup><br><sup>"Have I changed?"Hiro... Maam..."</sup></p>
<p id="L133">"Espy, ......."<br><sup>「エスピ……」</sup><br><sup>"Espi..."</sup></p>
<p id="L134">"Is it the same?　Maybe I'm just like ...... Hiiro and Ma'am and I've become a ...... boring adult."<br><sup>「同じかな？　私も……ヒイロとマアムと同じで……つまらない大人になっちゃったのかもね」</sup><br><sup>"Is it the same? Me too... just like Hiro and Maam... maybe I've become a boring adult."</sup></p>
<p id="L135"><br></p>
<p id="L136">And I can't believe I'm laughing so lonely. ...... Gaze into the distance. ...... What are you thinking. ...... What do you see... ...but ......<br><sup>そして、こんなに寂しく笑うなんて……遠くを見つめて……何を考えて……何を見て……でも……</sup><br><sup>And I can't believe I'm laughing so lonely... looking far away... thinking... looking at... but...</sup></p>

<p id="L138">"Espy ...... we want to go after our son."<br><sup>「エスピ……私たちは息子を追いかけたいの」</sup><br><sup>"Espi... we want to go after our son."</sup></p>
<p id="L139">"............"<br><sup>「…………」</sup><br><sup>「…………」</sup></p>

<p id="L141"><br></p>
<p id="L142">Priorities are set.<br><sup>優先することは決まっている。</sup><br><sup>It is decided that priority should be given.</sup></p>
