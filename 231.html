<p id="L2"><br></p>
<p id="L3">Cron and Yamidire did not return to Kakretele. As soon as they told everyone who had been patched up that they were not going back, there was an outcry of astonishment.<br><sup>クロンとヤミディレがカクレテールへ戻らない。いや、戻れないことについてを手当てを終えた皆に伝えた瞬間、驚愕の声が上がった。</sup><br><sup>Cron and Yamidile do not return to Kakretail.No, as soon as I told everyone that I couldn't go back, I was surprised.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">Of course. Most of the people here are like Yamidire's disciples.<br><sup>当然だ。ここに居る連中のほとんどが、ヤミディレの弟子みたいなもんだからな。</sup><br><sup>Of course. Most of the people here are like Yamidile's disciples.</sup></p>
<p id="L5"><br></p>
<p id="L6">"Why would you do that?　We promised everyone that we would return together!<br><sup>「そんな、どうしてっすか！？　私ら、皆に必ず皆で帰るって約束したんすよ！？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, why!?We promised everyone we'd all go home together!"</sup></p>
<p id="L7">"I don't think so!　The battle is over,......, and what would we do without you two,......?"<br><sup>「そうかな！　せっかく戦いは終わったのに……それに、お二人が居なければ私たちはこれからどうすれば……」</sup><br><sup>"I see! The battle is over... and what should we do from now on without you two?"</sup></p>
<p id="L8"><br></p>
<p id="L9">This is especially true for Karui and Tsukushi's sister, who have been like family to them.<br><sup>これまで家族のように共に過ごしてきたカルイやツクシの姉さんは特にそうだ。</sup><br><sup>This is especially true of the older sisters of Karui and Tsukushi, who have lived together like family members.</sup></p>
<p id="L10">I'm already clinging to it with tears in my eyes.<br><sup>既に涙を流してしがみついている。</sup><br><sup>I've been clinging to it with tears in my eyes.</sup></p>
<p id="L11"><br></p>
<p id="L12">"Thank you, guys. For thinking of us so much. ......"<br><sup>「ありがとうございます、みんな。私たちをそこまで想ってくださって……」</sup><br><sup>"Thank you, gentlemen.They thought of us that much..."</sup></p>
<p id="L13">"Goddess!"<br><sup>「女神様！」</sup><br><sup>"Goddess!"</sup></p>
<p id="L14">"But this is a decision we've already made. We can't go back to Kakreter anymore."<br><sup>「でも、これはもう決めたことなのです。もう私たちはカクレテールに戻ることはできないのです」</sup><br><sup>"But this is already a decision.We can't go back to Cacletale any more."</sup></p>
<p id="L15">"I don't know why!　Are you worried about what happened this time?　I don't think any of us would hold a grudge against the two of you!<br><sup>「ど、どうしてかな！　ひょっとして、今回のことを気に病まれて！？　そんなの私たち誰もお二人を恨んでないかな！」</sup><br><sup>"Why, I wonder!By any chance, you're worried about this!?I wonder if neither of us has any grudge against you!"</sup></p>
<p id="L16">"Tucsi: ......"<br><sup>「ツクシ……」</sup><br><sup>"Tsukushi..."</sup></p>
<p id="L17">"Or are you just worried about what would happen if it happened again?　I don't know if I can handle that!　Many times we are ......"<br><sup>「それとも、もしまた同じようなことがあった場合を気にされ？　そんなの大丈夫かな！　何度だって私たちは……」</sup><br><sup>"Or do you care if something similar happens again?"I wonder if that's all right!We'll... over and over again."</sup></p>
<p id="L18">"That's not good enough."<br><sup>「それではダメなのです」</sup><br><sup>"That won't do,"</sup></p>
<p id="L19">"What?<br><sup>「ッ！？」</sup><br><sup>"What!"</sup></p>
<p id="L20"><br></p>
<p id="L21">Tsukushi's sisters cling to her, saying they don't want to leave her.<br><sup>どうしても別れたくないと縋るツクシの姉さんたち。</sup><br><sup>Tsukushi's sisters cling to me saying they really don't want to break up.</sup></p>
<p id="L22">In the midst of all this, Mr. Machaut kept his cool.<br><sup>そんな中で、マチョウさんは冷静だった。</sup><br><sup>Meanwhile, Matthew was calm.</sup></p>
<p id="L23"><br></p>
<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25">"If Earth Ragan had not been here today, we would have been defeated ...... and all of us would have been killed."<br><sup>「今日、アース・ラガンがここに居なければ、自分たちは敗れていた……全員殺されていただろう」</sup><br><sup>"If Earth Lagan hadn't been here today, we would have been defeated... all killed."</sup></p>
<p id="L26"><br></p>
<p id="L27">"Mr. Macheteau?"<br><sup>「マチョウさん！？」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Matthew!"</sup></p>
<p id="L28"><br></p>
<p id="L29">"And Earth. It's not like you and the goddess are going to become husband and wife and live in Kakuretail forever,......, is it?　Then, if the same thing happens again,......, above all, the master teacher is also sealed in power,......, and now we are,......, that's how it is. I guess."<br><sup>「そしてアース。お前は女神様と夫婦となっていつまでもカクレテールで暮らす……というわけでもないのだろう？　ならば、もしまた同じようなことがあったら……何よりも師範も力が封じられている……今の自分たちでは……そういうことなのだろう」</sup><br><sup>"And Earth,"You're not going to be married to a goddess and live in Kakretail forever, are you?Then, if something similar happens again... above all, the teacher is sealed off... that's what we are now... I guess that's what it is."</sup></p>
<p id="L30"><br></p>
<p id="L31"><br></p>
<p id="L32">If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have won today. ...... or ...... Let's not even mention that this might not have happened if I hadn't fought Yamidire and worn him down in the first place... ...<br><sup>俺が居なければ今日は勝てなかった……か……そもそも、俺がヤミディレと戦って消耗させなければこうなってなかったかもしれないことは黙っておくか……</sup><br><sup>If it weren't for me, I wouldn't have won today... or... in the first place, I wouldn't have done this if I hadn't fought and consumed Yamidire...</sup></p>
<p id="L33"><br></p>
<p id="L34">"This battle has made me understand. We were weak. We were powerless. Tsukushi, Karui, everyone. If you swear an oath to always protect someone, you must have the strength ...... to do so, or else nothing will make sense."<br><sup>「今回の戦いで理解した。自分たちは弱い。無力だった。ツクシ、カルイ、皆。誰かを必ず守りぬくと誓いを口にするならば……相応の強さを持たねば何も意味を成さない」</sup><br><sup>"I understood it through this battle.We are weak.I was helpless. Tsukushi, Kalui, everyone.If you say your oath to protect someone... nothing will make sense unless you have the right strength."</sup></p>
<p id="L35"><br></p>
<p id="L36">Today was like a new day of determination for Kron, Fiancé, Rival, Fu, the prince, and even Machou.<br><sup>今日はクロン、フィアンセイ、リヴァル、フー、王子、更にはマチョウさんたちにとっても新たな決意日みたいなもんになっちまったな。</sup><br><sup>It's like a new day of determination for Cron, Fiancee, Rival, Who, Prince, and even Matthew.</sup></p>
<p id="L37">That disastrous defeat in the battle with the Parisians instilled a further change in the consciousness of Mr. Machou, who by nature boasts superhuman strength and yet usually works untouchably hard.<br><sup>あのパリピとの戦いによる惨敗が、本来なら超人級の力を誇り、それでいて普段から手の付けられないほど努力をするマチョウさんに更なる意識の改革を植え付けた。</sup><br><sup>The crushing defeat in the war against Paripi instilled further consciousness reform in Mr. Muncho, who was originally superhuman in power and still worked so hard that he could not control himself.</sup></p>
<p id="L38">And when they heard Machou's words, everyone who had been shouting nothing but disapproval that Kron and the others had not returned to Kakreterre also frowned, each with a complicated look on their face.<br><sup>そして、マチョウさんの言葉を聞いて、クロンたちがカクレテールへ戻らないことに不服しか叫んでいなかった皆もそれぞれ複雑そうに顔を顰めた。</sup><br><sup>and at Matthew's words, everyone, who had nothing but complaints that the clones would not return to Kakretail, frowned complicatedly.</sup></p>
<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">"We were ...... weak, ...... sure ...... are we?"<br><sup>「私たちが……弱かった……確かに……そうかな」</sup><br><sup>"We were... weak... I'm sure... I guess so."</sup></p>
<p id="L41">"I've been on the ...... run a lot in the end, too. ......<br><sup>「私も……最終的に逃げ回ってばっかだったっす……」</sup><br><sup>"Me too... I just ran around in the end..."</sup></p>
<p id="L42">"It's the same for all of us at ......."<br><sup>「それを言うなら……皆、同じでごわす」</sup><br><sup>"If you say that... they're all the same."</sup></p>
<p id="L43">"My crotch is also ......"<br><sup>「俺の股間も……」</sup><br><sup>"My crotch..."</sup></p>
<p id="L44">"I was also killed in the blink of an eye: ......"<br><sup>「私も瞬殺された……」</sup><br><sup>"I was killed in an instant..."</sup></p>
<p id="L45">"When I get back to fucking ......, I'm going to triple the amount of muscle training I do."<br><sup>「クソ……帰ったら筋トレの量を三倍に増やしてやる」</sup><br><sup>"No... I'll triple the amount of muscle training when I get home."</sup></p>
<p id="L46">"I got 10,000 fist bumps.<br><sup>「俺は正拳突き一万本だ」</sup><br><sup>"I'm 10,000 straight fists."</sup></p>
<p id="L47"><br></p>
<p id="L48">We were weak. We were weak, and everyone seemed to understand that.<br><sup>自分たちが弱かった。それが身に染みて皆が分かったようだ。</sup><br><sup>We were weak.It seems to have penetrated everyone.</sup></p>
<p id="L49">And Mr. Machou represented all of us at ......<br><sup>そしてマチョウさんはそんな皆を代表して……</sup><br><sup>And Mr. Matthew represents everyone like that...</sup></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51"><br></p>
<p id="L52">"Master. We will not neglect our training even in your absence. We will become ...... stronger so that the two of you can protect yourselves this time without any worries."<br><sup>「師範。自分たちは、師範不在でも鍛錬は怠りません。お二人が今度こそ何の不安に思うことなく守り切れるよう……強くなってみせます」</sup><br><sup>"Senior, we don't neglect training even if we're not there.This time, I'll try to be strong so that you two can protect each other without worrying about anything."</sup></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54">"Macho......"<br><sup>「マチョウ……」</sup><br><sup>"Machow..."</sup></p>
<p id="L55"><br></p>
<p id="L56">"So, ...... we would like you to live with us once again ...... then. I will make sure that Kakretele will recover as well."<br><sup>「ですから……その時はもう一度……自分たちと共に暮らしていただきたい。カクレテールも必ず復興させてみせます」</sup><br><sup>"So... I want you to live with us again then.I'll make sure to rebuild Cacletail."</sup></p>
<p id="L57"><br></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">Mr. Machaut's words made me, Fiancé and the others feel indescribable.<br><sup>マチョウさんの言葉に俺やフィアンセイたちは何とも言えない気分になった。</sup><br><sup>Matthew's words made me and my fiancees feel indescribable.</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">"High Priestess, please!"<br><sup>「大神官様、お願いかな！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, Lord, please!"</sup></p>
<p id="L62">"We're gonna be strong!"<br><sup>「私たち、強くなるッス！」</sup><br><sup>"We're getting stronger!"</sup></p>
<p id="L63">"This time, I'll make sure of it!"<br><sup>「今度こそ、必ずでごわす！」</sup><br><sup>`I'll make sure to do it this time!'</sup></p>
<p id="L64">"Master!"<br><sup>「師範！」</sup><br><sup>"Master!"</sup></p>
<p id="L65">"Goddess!"<br><sup>「女神様！」</sup><br><sup>"Goddess!"</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">In the future, Kakretele will have an outside hand, like the Coalition.<br><sup>これから先、カクレテールには連合のような外部からの手が入るだろう。</sup><br><sup>From now on, Cacletail will be joined by outsiders like the Union.</sup></p>
<p id="L68">Because they already knew that my father was involved and that Yamidire was living in that country.<br><sup>何故なら、既に親父が関り、そしてヤミディレがあの国で住んでいたとバレちまったからだ。</sup><br><sup>for it was discovered that his father had already been involved, and that he had lived in that country.</sup></p>
<p id="L69">Most importantly, according to Parisi, outside help is essential to revive the current Kakuretail.<br><sup>何よりもパリピの話だと、今のカクレテールを復興させるには、外部からの支援が必要不可欠だって話だし。</sup><br><sup>Above all, Paripi says that external support is indispensable to rebuild the current Kakretail.</sup></p>
<p id="L70">That being the case, I wonder if there will ever be a day when Yamidire, the world's highest-paid bounty hunter, can once again live proudly in Kakretele. ......<br><sup>そうである以上、世界最高額級の賞金首であるヤミディレが再びカクレテールで堂々と暮らせる日がくるのか……だが……</sup><br><sup>As long as that's the case, will the day come when Yamidile, the world's highest prize winner, will be able to live proudly in Kakretail again... but...</sup></p>
<p id="L71"><br></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">"Well, well, ...... all ...... be diligent."<br><sup>「ふ、まあ……全員……精進するがよい」</sup><br><sup>"Well, well... everyone... work hard."</sup></p>
<p id="L74"><br></p>
<p id="L75">"Good luck, everyone!"<br><sup>「皆さん、ガンバです！」</sup><br><sup>"Everyone, it's Gamba!"</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77"><br></p>
<p id="L78">I'm sure Yamidire knows this, but he doesn't mention it.<br><sup>ヤミディレもそのことを分かっているのだろうが、それは口にしない。</sup><br><sup>Yamidile probably knows that, but he doesn't say that.</sup></p>
<p id="L79">There may have been a lot of scheming going on behind the scenes, or maybe it was just a place or relationship that they were trying to take advantage of, but Yamidire has a heart too.<br><sup>色々と裏では企みがあったり、利用しようとしていただけの場所や人間関係だったのかもしれないが、ヤミディレにも心はある。</sup><br><sup>There may have been a lot of behind-the-scenes schemes, places and relationships that I was just trying to use, but Yamidire also has a heart.</sup></p>
<p id="L80">These were the disciples that he had spent more than ten years with, and who he had carefully nurtured.<br><sup>十年以上も過ごし、更には自分が手塩をかけて育てた弟子たちだ。</sup><br><sup>They spent more than ten years, and even raised them with salt.</sup></p>
<p id="L81">He seemed to have his own thoughts on the matter and only spoke words of encouragement.<br><sup>それなりに思うところはあるようで、ただ激励の言葉だけを口にした。</sup><br><sup>He seemed to have his own way of thinking, but only encouraging words of encouragement.</sup></p>
<p id="L82"><br></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">「「「「「Oshinobu！！！！」」」」」<br><sup>「「「「「押忍ッ！！！！」」」」」</sup><br><sup>"""'Pushin'!!!'""</sup></p>
<p id="L85"><br></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">A spirited voice that vibrated with energy and a bow echoed at the end.<br><sup>ビリビリと振動が伝わる気合の籠った声と一礼が最後に響いた。</sup><br><sup>The enthusiastic voice and bow echoed at the end.</sup></p>
<p id="L88"><br></p>
<p id="L89">"Does that mean Earth will be gone too?"<br><sup>「ってことは、アースももう居なくなるのか？」</sup><br><sup>"So Earth is no longer here?"</sup></p>
<p id="L90">"Seriously, I haven't had a crotch match with you yet!"<br><sup>「まじかよ、まだお前とは股間勝負してねーぞ！」</sup><br><sup>"Really, I haven't played a crotch game with you yet!"</sup></p>
<p id="L91">"Where's your ass?"<br><sup>「お尻は！？」</sup><br><sup>"What about your buttocks?"</sup></p>
<p id="L92">"I heard you can use a sword as well. I'd love to match you with my Seven Star Sword. ......"<br><sup>「お前は剣も使えると聞く。俺の七星の剣と是非手合わせしたいのに……」</sup><br><sup>"I hear you can use a sword.I'd love to play with my seven-star sword..."</sup></p>
<p id="L93">"Where do you think you're going?<br><sup>「君はどこへ行くつもりアル？」</sup><br><sup>"Where are you going, Al?"</sup></p>
<p id="L94">"Wow, are you serious, An-chan?"<br><sup>「うぇ～、あんちゃんマジっすか！？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, really, my dear!"</sup></p>
<p id="L95">"Mr. Earth!"<br><sup>「アースくん！」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Earth!"</sup></p>
<p id="L96"><br></p>
<p id="L97">And now that I'm leaving, Tsukushi's sister, Karui, and the rest of the miserable people I've spent the last few months with are all clinging to me.<br><sup>そして、俺もここでお別れということでこの数ヶ月一緒に過ごしたツクシの姉さんやカルイや他のむさ苦しい連中も一斉にしがみついてくる。</sup><br><sup>And Tsukushi's sister, Kalui, and other filthy people who have been with me for the past few months are clinging to me because I'm going to say goodbye here.</sup></p>
<p id="L98"><br></p>
<p id="L99">"Oh, well, I'll come visit you once in a while ...... when things settle down."<br><sup>「あ～、まぁ、俺もたまに遊びに来るよ……落ち着いたらな」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, well, I come to see you once in a while... when I calm down."</sup></p>
<p id="L100">"Absolutely."<br><sup>「絶対かな！」</sup><br><sup>"Absolutely!"</sup></p>
<p id="L101">"Absolutely!<br><sup>「絶対すよ！」</sup><br><sup>"Absolutely!"</sup></p>
<p id="L102"><br></p>
<p id="L103">In the meantime, I can at least come back and play again, unlike Yamidire.<br><sup>とりあえず、俺はヤミディレと違ってまた遊びに来ることぐらいはできるだろう。</sup><br><sup>First of all, unlike Yamidile, I will be able to come and see you again.</sup></p>
<p id="L104">But that's only if the Coalition of Dads is less strict. ......<br><sup>ただし、親父たち連合の目が厳しくなくなったらの話だが……</sup><br><sup>However, if the eyes of the Fathers Union are less strict...</sup></p>
<p id="L105"><br></p>
<p id="L106">"Earth, you've been good to me.<br><sup>「アース、世話になったな」</sup><br><sup>"Earth, thank you very much."</sup></p>
<p id="L107">"Mr. Macheteau."<br><sup>「マチョウさん」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Matthew,"</sup></p>
<p id="L108">"I'm glad you're here. I'm still working out myself."<br><sup>「お前が居てくれてよかった。自分もまだまだ鍛錬に励む」</sup><br><sup>"I'm glad you're here.I'm still trying to train myself."</sup></p>
<p id="L109">"Yeah, I'm grateful, too. I'm grateful too, because my battle with Mr. Machou pushed me to the next level."<br><sup>「ああ、俺も感謝してるぜ。マチョウさんとのバトルが俺を次のステージへ押し上げてくれたんだからよ」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, I'm grateful, too.The battle with Matthew pushed me to the next stage."</sup></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111">I high-fived Mr. Machou and said goodbye to everyone I met at Kakuretail. ......<br><sup>マチョウさんとパチンとハイタッチし、カクレテールで出会った皆と別れの挨拶を交わし……</sup><br><sup>I snapped a high five with Matthew and said goodbye to everyone I met in Kakretail...</sup></p>
<p id="L112"><br></p>
<p id="L113">"Well, it's time to send you on your way."<br><sup>「さて、そろそろ君たちを送ろう」</sup><br><sup>"Now, let's send you off,"</sup></p>
<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115">The prince claps his hands, signaling his departure.<br><sup>王子が手を叩いて、出発の合図を出す。</sup><br><sup>The prince clapped his hands to signal his departure.</sup></p>
<p id="L116"><br></p>
<p id="L117">"I don't know.　Well, we all get on a fishing boat ...... ah ......, but Hillua gets a ride with Cron and Yamidire, and I ......."<br><sup>「ん？　そういや、皆で漁船に乗って……あ……でも、ヒルアはクロンとヤミディレを乗せてもらうし、俺も……」</sup><br><sup>"Huh? No, we're all on a fishing boat... Oh... but Hillua will have Cron and Yamidire on board, and so will I."</sup></p>
<p id="L118">"Oh, about that, the ship you came in on seemed to be in a lot of disrepair, so I think I'll repair it and return it to you later.<br><sup>「ああ、そのことなのだが、君たちが乗ってきた船は相当痛んでいたようなので、後でこちらで修理してお返ししようと思う」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that is to say, the ship you boarded seems to have been badly damaged, and I'll fix it up and return it to you later."</sup></p>
<p id="L119">"Oh, really?　But if that's the case, how are we going to get ...... you guys to carry us down?<br><sup>「え、あ、そうなのか？　でも、そうなると俺らはどうやって……あんたらがまさか担いで降ろしてくれるのか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, really?"But then how will we... will you carry me down?"</sup></p>
<p id="L120">"It's okay. A few dozen people can ...... Come on, little birds!　Come on!"<br><sup>「大丈夫。数十人ぐらいなら……さあ、小鳥たち！　おいで！」</sup><br><sup>"It's all right. Dozens of people... Come here, little birds!"</sup></p>
<p id="L121"><br></p>
<p id="L122">When I said I was going back, I couldn't go back the same way I went back, so I thought the angels were going to ombre me one by one, but it was a little different.<br><sup>帰ると言っても行きと同じ方法では帰れないので、まさか天使たちが一人一々オンブでもしてくれんのかと思ったら、少し違った。</sup><br><sup>Even if I say I'm going home, I can't go home the same way I go, so I thought angels would do ombuds one by one, but it was a little different.</sup></p>
<p id="L123"><br></p>
<p id="L124">"Oh!　Pegasus ......, I've only seen it in picture books. ...... It's real? ......"<br><sup>「おおお！　ぺ、ペガサス……え、絵本でしか見たことないのに……実在したのか……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh! Pe, Pegasus... well, I've only seen it in picture books... did it really exist?"</sup></p>
<p id="L125">"Oh, my God!　Really?"<br><sup>「へえ！　マジすか！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, really!"</sup></p>
<p id="L126">"Wow, is that amazing?"<br><sup>「わ、すごいかな！」</sup><br><sup>"Wow, that's great!"</sup></p>
<p id="L127"><br></p>
<p id="L128">The moment the prince clapped his hands, dozens of war maidens astride the white heavenly horse ......, or Pegasus, appeared.<br><sup>王子が手を叩いた瞬間、白き天馬……すなわち、ペガサスに跨った戦乙女たちが数十騎現れた。</sup><br><sup>As soon as the prince clapped his hands, dozens of girls appeared across the Pegasus.</sup></p>
<p id="L129">The princesses are giddy with excitement at the sight of the beautiful furry pegasus.<br><sup>美しい毛並みのペガサスを目の当たりにして、姫たちは目を輝かせて興奮してる。</sup><br><sup>The princesses are excited with shining eyes at the sight of Pegasus, who has beautiful hair.</sup></p>
<p id="L130"><br></p>
<p id="L131">"One by one, ride behind them. I'll send you on a heavenly horse, the pride of the sky world, driven by my cute little birds."<br><sup>「一人一々、彼女たちの後ろに乗りたまえ。僕のカワイイ小鳥たちが操る、天空世界が誇る天馬でお送りしよう」</sup><br><sup>"Get behind them one by one.I'll send it to you in the heavenly world proud of my cute little birds."</sup></p>
<p id="L132">「「「「「 ooohhhh!!! 」」」」」<br><sup>「「「「「オオオオオオオオッッ！！！」」」」」</sup><br><sup>"""'Oh my gosh!'""</sup></p>
<p id="L133"><br></p>
<p id="L134">And when they give you a ride on such a Pegasus, naturally the men are excited ......<br><sup>そして、そんなペガサスに乗せてくれるとなったら、当然男たちも興奮……</sup><br><sup>And naturally, men would be excited if they could give me such a ride on Pegasus...</sup></p>
<p id="L135"><br></p>
<p id="L136">"Oh, really?　Behind that really cute little angel?"<br><sup>「うお、マジか！　あのめちゃんこカワイイ天使ちゃんの後ろに？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, really! Behind that cute little angel?"</sup></p>
<p id="L137">"Damn. ...... in the throes."<br><sup>「くぅ～、どさくさに紛れて……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, in the confusion..."</sup></p>
<p id="L138">"The seven stars are buzzing. ...... Is it now time to meet the woman of your dreams, guided by the stars?"<br><sup>「七つの星がざわついている……星の導きにより運命の女に出会うのは、今？」</sup><br><sup>"Seven stars are buzzing... is it now that you meet the woman of fate through the guidance of the stars?"</sup></p>
<p id="L139"><br></p>
<p id="L140">Well, simply because you can sit closely behind the cute angels ...... these guys .......<br><sup>まぁ、単純にカワイイ天使たちの後ろに密着して座れるからか……こいつら……</sup><br><sup>Well, maybe it's because I can simply sit close behind cute angels... these guys...</sup></p>
<p id="L141"><br></p>
<p id="L142">"Prince ......, are you sure you want to do this?　His Majesty hasn't even regained consciousness yet. ...... And then there's the matter of Yamidire. ......"<br><sup>「王子……本当によろしいのですか？　まだ、陛下の意識も戻られていないのにこんな……それに、ヤミディレのことも……」</sup><br><sup>"Prince... Are you sure you don't mind?"Even though His Majesty's consciousness has not been restored yet, like this... and about the Yamidire..."</sup></p>
<p id="L143">"Oh. I'll take full responsibility. No matter what my father says, I'll take care of everything. So I need your help, too."<br><sup>「ああ。責任はすべて僕が。たとえ、父が何と言おうとも、全て僕が何とかしてみせる。だから、君たちも力を貸して欲しい」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, I'll take all the responsibility.No matter what my father says, I'll do something about it.So I want you to help me, too."</sup></p>
<p id="L144">"...... Oh, wow, I'd ...... go anywhere and do anything ...... for the prince."<br><sup>「……あ、わ、私は……王子のためでしたら……どこまでも、何でも……」</sup><br><sup>"...oh, wow, I...for the prince...for ever and ever..."</sup></p>
<p id="L145"><br></p>
<p id="L146">I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's a good idea.<br><sup>つか、そんな野郎どもの空気に天使たちは顔を青ざめさせていかにも嫌そうな表情だ。</sup><br><sup>The angels turned pale in the air and looked disgusted.</sup></p>
<p id="L147">That's because unlike the prince, these guys didn't see the battle inside the palace, so they might not be too convinced that we're actually the benefactors who saved the sky world~, so they might not want to stick close to the swarthy guy even though it's the prince's order.<br><sup>そりゃ、王子と違ってこいつらは宮殿の中での戦いを見ていたわけでもないから、俺たちが実は天空世界を救った恩人だ～みたいなことを言われても、あんまり納得できてないのかもしれないから、王子の命令とはいえむさ苦しい男と密着するのは嫌なのかもな。</sup><br><sup>Well, unlike the prince, they weren't watching the battle in the palace, so they might not be very convinced if we were actually told that we were the benefactors who saved the heavenly world, so they might not like to be in close contact with a disgusting man even though it was the prince's order.</sup></p>
<p id="L148"><br></p>
<p id="L149"><br></p>
<p id="L150">"Oh, men. I just want to remind you that no matter how much I owe you, if you do anything indecent to my cute little birds, I will throw you overboard.<br><sup>「ああ、男性諸君。言っておくけど、いくら君たちに恩があるとはいえ、僕のカワイイ小鳥たちに何か猥褻なことをしたらそのまま海に落とすので気を付けたまえ」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, gentlemen,"I'll tell you, no matter how much I owe you, if I do anything obscene to my cute little birds, I'll just drop them into the sea."</sup></p>
<p id="L151"><br></p>
<p id="L152">「「「「...... yes......」」」」<br><sup>「「「「……はい……」」」」</sup><br><sup>"'...yes...'"</sup></p>
<p id="L153"><br></p>
<p id="L154"><br></p>
<p id="L155">Well, the prince gave a warning that probably wasn't a threat, so I'm sure the bastards will be fine, but he still can't hide his happiness.<br><sup>まっ、とりあえず王子が多分脅しじゃなさそうな注意をしたので野郎共も大丈夫だろうけど、でもやはり嬉しそうな様子は隠せていない。</sup><br><sup>Well, for now, the prince warned me that it probably wasn't a threat, so I guess they're all right, but I still can't hide their happy appearance.</sup></p>
<p id="L156">And it was the same for the princesses who genuinely witnessed Pegasus.<br><sup>そして、それは純粋にペガサスを目の当たりにした姫たちも同じだ。</sup><br><sup>and so were the princesses who had seen Pegasus purely.</sup></p>
<p id="L157"><br></p>
<p id="L158">"Oh, wow, I'm also a ...... pegasus and ...... oh ...... hmm, I wonder if I can bring even one of them back to the imperial capital... ..."<br><sup>「おお、わ、我も……ペガサスに……ほぉ……ううむ、一頭でも帝都に持って帰れないものだろうか……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, wow, me too... to Pegasus... oh... well, I wonder if I can bring even one back to the imperial capital..."</sup></p>
<p id="L159">"Surely, this will make shopping much easier, and in case of a crisis, we can easily cross mountains and oceans to get to the little boy.<br><sup>「確かに、これならば買い物はとても楽になりますし、坊ちゃまの危機には山も海も越えて簡単に駆け付けられるでしょう」</sup><br><sup>"Certainly, this will make shopping much easier, and it will be easy to run across mountains and seas in the face of a boy's crisis."</sup></p>
<p id="L160"><br></p>
<p id="L161">And in the midst of all this, there's a surprising guy: ......<br><sup>で、そんな中、意外な奴も……</sup><br><sup>And in the meantime, there's an unexpected guy...</sup></p>
<p id="L162"><br></p>
<p id="L163">'Huh, a pegasus. ...... I couldn't care less about it when I was fighting. ...... Hmmm ...... I thought its legs would be weak since it mainly moves by wings. I thought it had weak legs because it moved mostly on its wings. ...... It also carries its thorns well. ...... Hoho......<br><sup>『ほぅ、ペガサスか……戦いのときはあまり気にしていられなかったが……ふむ……翼での移動が主のため、脚は弱いと思ったが……トモの運びもしっかりしている……ほほう……』</sup><br><sup>'Oh, Pegasus... I didn't really care about it during the battle... well... I thought my legs were weak mainly because of the movement with wings... but Tomo is also carrying well... hahaha...'</sup></p>
<p id="L164"><br></p>
<p id="L165">It was Traina by his side.<br><sup>それは、傍らのトレイナだった。</sup><br><sup>It was Trina beside him.</sup></p>
<p id="L166">He watched the herd of Pegasus strutting in front of him with great interest.<br><sup>目の前を闊歩するペガサスの群れを興味深そうに眺めている。</sup><br><sup>He looked at the crowd of Pegasus strutting in front of him with interest.</sup></p>
<p id="L167"><br></p>
<p id="L168">What is it, Traina? Are you interested in the Pegasus too?<br><sup>『なんだよ、トレイナ。あんたもペガサスに興味あるのか？』</sup><br><sup>"What, Trina?Are you interested in Pegasus?"</sup></p>
<p id="L169">"Well, I hadn't seen much of it myself. But in terms of interest, it's not so much Pegasus, but horses in general.<br><sup>『まぁ、余もあまり見たことがなかったからな。だが、興味という意味で言うなら、ペガサスというよりは馬全般にだがな』</sup><br><sup>'Well, I haven't seen much of it.But in the sense of interest, not so much Pegasus as a whole.'</sup></p>
<p id="L170">"What?　Horses?　What, have you been riding a ...... horse too?　What?　You did?　What's the point of ...... riding a horse?<br><sup>『は？　馬？　なんだよ、あんた……馬にも乗ってたのか？　え？　あんたが？　馬に乗る……意味あるのか？』</sup><br><sup>'Huh? Horse? What, you... were you riding a horse?What? You? Riding a horse... Is it meaningful?'</sup></p>
<p id="L171"><br></p>
<p id="L172">Another unexpected aspect of Traina that was taught to me in a casual manner.<br><sup>またもやサラリと教えられたトレイナの意外な一面。</sup><br><sup>Once again, the unexpected side of Trina was taught smoothly.</sup></p>
<p id="L173">I mean, he could have flown over any place, or done something like warp in a flash, and he wouldn't need to ride a horse or anything like that. ......<br><sup>ってか、こいつならどんな場所でも空飛んだり、ワープであっという間みたいなことできただろうし、馬とかに乗る必要ないんじゃ……</sup><br><sup>I mean, he could have flown anywhere and done something like a warp in no time, and he didn't have to ride a horse or anything like that."</sup></p>
<p id="L174"><br></p>
<p id="L175">'I didn't ride for transportation. I was simply riding as a hobby.<br><sup>『別に移動のために乗っていたわけではない。単純に趣味として乗っていた』</sup><br><sup>'I wasn't on board to move.I rode it simply as a hobby.'</sup></p>
<p id="L176">"Hobby?<br><sup>『趣味？』</sup><br><sup>"Hobby?"</sup></p>
<p id="L177">"Yes. This is the reason why it's so important to keep your identity a secret and compete in races on earth and in the demon world with your beloved horses.<br><sup>『うむ。それこそかつては正体を隠して、地上や魔界競馬に愛馬たちと共に参戦したものだ』</sup><br><sup>'Well, that's what I used to hide my identity and participate in horse racing on the ground and in the magical world.'</sup></p>
<p id="L178">"...... What?　Oh, you're ...... horse racing?<br><sup>『……なに！？　あ、あんたが……競馬！？』</sup><br><sup>'...what!? Oh, you... horse racing!?</sup></p>
<p id="L179">I used to be known as the world's best leading jockey. I used to be known as the world's best leading jockey, even though my identity was unknown, and I won the Demon World Derby and many other major races.<br><sup>『ふっ、驚くな。余はかつて、正体不明にして世界最高のリーディングジョッキーと呼ばれ、魔界ダービーを始めとした数々の重賞レースを制覇したものだ』</sup><br><sup>"Well, don't be surprised.We used to be called the world's best leading jockey without identification, and we won many heavy prize races, including the magical Derby.'</sup></p>
<p id="L180"><br></p>
<p id="L181">Traina, with arms crossed and a smug look on her face, tells the saga: ...... No, ...... I'm speechless: ......<br><sup>腕組んでドヤ顔で武勇伝を語るトレイナ……いや……言葉が出ない……</sup><br><sup>Trina talks about her bravery with her arms folded... no... I can't speak...</sup></p>
<p id="L182"><br></p>
<p id="L183"><br></p>
<p id="L184">I miss ...... my beloved horse, Kanku Brian, who won the Triple Crown in horse racing in the demon world. ...... Fuka Impact ...... they were all good horses. ......<br><sup>『懐かしい……魔界競馬において三冠を取った余の愛馬・カンクウブライアン……フカインパクト……皆、良い馬だった……』</sup><br><sup>"I miss you... my beloved horse, Kankubrian, who won three gold medals in horse racing in the magical world...

<p id="L185"><br></p>
<p id="L186">"Oh, yeah. ......<br><sup>『そ、そうか……』</sup><br><sup>"Well, I see..."</sup></p>
<p id="L187"><br></p>
<p id="L188">"Oh, by the way, I'd like to invite you to ---- for the world's top prize in the terrestrial world.<br><sup>『そういえば、地上世界における世界最高峰の『出陣門賞』に――――』</sup><br><sup>"Come to think of it, it's the highest 'Exhibition Gate Award' in the world????????"</sup></p>
<p id="L189"><br></p>
<p id="L190"><br></p>
<p id="L191">And just when her eyes were beginning to sparkle with enthusiasm as she talked about the past.<br><sup>と、段々と昔語りに熱が籠ってトレイナの眼がキラキラし始めた丁度その時だった。</sup><br><sup>It was just then that Trina's eyes began to sparkle with the growing enthusiasm of the old story.</sup></p>
<p id="L192"><br></p>
<p id="L193"><br></p>
<p id="L194">"Come on, kid. You're headed somewhere different from everyone else, aren't you?　Like the Goddess and Yamidire."<br><sup>「さぁ、坊や。君は皆とは違う所へ向かうのだろう？　女神とヤミディレと同じで」</sup><br><sup>"Now, boy.Are you going somewhere different from everyone else?Just like the goddess and the yamidile."</sup></p>

<p id="L196">"Hmm?　Oh, yeah, I'm halfway to ......."<br><sup>「ん？　あ、ああ……途中までだけどな」</sup><br><sup>"Huh? Oh, oh... halfway through."</sup></p>
<p id="L197"><br></p>
<p id="L198"><br></p>
<p id="L199">When I realized that everyone was already getting ready to ride the Pegasus for two, and it looked like I was the only one left, the prince smiled freshly and said: ......<br><sup>気付けば皆が既にペガサスに二人乗りの準備をしていて、余っているのが俺だけっぽくなったとき、王子が爽やかに微笑んで……</sup><br><sup>When I realized that everyone was already getting ready to ride in Pegasus, and I was the only one left, the prince smiled refreshingly...</sup></p>

<p id="L202">"Get in, boy."<br><sup>「乗りたまえ、坊や」</sup><br><sup>"Get in, boy,"</sup></p>
<p id="L203"><br></p>
<p id="L204">"Huh?<br><sup>「へ？」</sup><br><sup>"What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L205"><br></p>
<p id="L206">"I'll give you a lift. Anywhere you want."<br><sup>「君は僕が送ってあげるよ。どこへでも」</sup><br><sup>"I'll see you off.Anywhere."</sup></p>
<p id="L207"><br></p>
<p id="L208"><br></p>
<p id="L209">I'll keep it a secret for the rest of my life that I was almost upset when he said something that made me nervous because he was too beautiful to be a man.<br><sup>何だか同じ男なのに美形すぎてドキッとするようなことを言われて、思わず狼狽えそうになったのは一生秘密にしておこう。</sup><br><sup>I'll keep it a secret for the rest of my life that I almost got upset when I was told something that surprised me because I was so beautiful even though I was the same man.</sup></p>
<p id="L210">Because it will make things even more complicated.<br><sup>余計ややこしくなるから。</sup><br><sup>It's going to be even more complicated.</sup></p>

<p id="L212">"Oh, there's a ...... behind you?<br><sup>「あ、あんたの後ろに……？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, behind you..."</sup></p>
<p id="L213">"You don't like it?　Why don't you sit in front of me?　Why don't you sit in front of me between my arms at ......?　I'll hold you tight so you don't fall."<br><sup>「嫌かい？　なら、前に座るかい？　僕の腕と腕の間に……ね？　落ちないように、しっかりホールドしてあげるよ」</sup><br><sup>"You don't like it?

<p id="L221"><br></p>
<p id="L222">I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that the dividend rate for that race was huge because no one knew about the surplus. ......
