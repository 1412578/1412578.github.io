<p id="L1">The fact that the theme of the new training was the power of magic surprised me, partly because I honestly hadn't expected it, but it also excited me.<br><sup>新たな修行のテーマが魔法の力というのは、正直予想していなかったこともあって驚いたが、同時にワクワクもした。</sup><br><sup>To be honest, I was surprised that the new theme of training was magical power, but at the same time I was excited.</sup></p>
<p id="L2"><br></p>
<p id="L3">"Wow, ...... magic!"<br><sup>「へぇ……魔法か～」</sup><br><sup>"Oh... is it magic?"</sup></p>
<p id="L4"><br></p>
<p id="L5">I've learned and developed a lot of techniques in my training with Traina.<br><sup>これまでトレイナとのトレーニングで色々な技を会得し、そして開発してきた。</sup><br><sup>He has acquired and developed various skills through training with trainers.</sup></p>
<p id="L6">Fist fighting techniques. Breakthroughs. The Great Magic Spiral. Magical footwork. Magical breathing. Earth Misdirection Shuffle.<br><sup>拳闘術。ブレイクスルー。大魔螺旋。マジカルフットワーク。魔呼吸。アース・ミスディレクション・シャッフル。</sup><br><sup>Fist fighting. Breakthrough.Magic spiral. Magical footwork.Magic breathing.earth misdirection shuffle</sup></p>
<p id="L7">But it was a skill, but it was like a technique.<br><sup>ただ、それは技ではあるが、技術みたいなもんだった。</sup><br><sup>But it was a technique, but it was like technology.</sup></p>
<p id="L8">When I was a kid, I wanted to be a magic swordsman, but it wasn't that I didn't have any desire to be a wizard at all.<br><sup>ガキの頃は魔法剣士を目指していたが、魔法使いというものにまったく憧れていなかったわけでもない。</sup><br><sup>When he was a kid, he wanted to be a wizard, but it wasn't that he didn't yearn for wizards at all.</sup></p>
<p id="L9">At one time or another, everyone has the ambition to create a great magic that will surprise everyone.<br><sup>それこそ誰だって一度ぐらいは「皆が驚く大魔法を」みたいな野望を抱いたりするもんだ。</sup><br><sup>That's why everyone has the ambition of "a great magic that everyone is surprised by" at least once."</sup></p>
<p id="L10">The Great Demon King, Traina, is going to teach me magic.<br><sup>そんな俺に対して、あの大魔王トレイナが魔法を教えてくれるというのだ。</sup><br><sup>Trina, the demon king, teaches me magic.</sup></p>
<p id="L11">How could I not be excited?<br><sup>ワクワクしないはずがない。</sup><br><sup>There's no way I'm.</sup></p>
<p id="L12">If you learn awesome magic: ......<br><sup>もし、すげー魔法を覚えたら……</sup><br><sup>If you learn amazing magic...</sup></p>
<p id="L13"><br></p>
<p id="L14">--What?　You're saying you don't believe me because ...... my magic is too weak to believe, right?<br><sup>――え？　信じられないって……俺の魔法が弱すぎて信じられないってことだよなぁ？</sup><br><sup>What? I can't believe it... you mean my magic is too weak to believe, right?</sup></p>
<p id="L15"><br></p>
<p id="L16">Cool on the surface, hooray in the heart!<br><sup>表面クールで、心の中でどやぁ！</sup><br><sup>It's cool on the surface and in my heart!</sup></p>
<p id="L17"><br></p>
<p id="L18">--This is the Giga class, which is beyond the ...... Mega class, and the Terra class, which is beyond ...... yet another one!<br><sup>――これが……メガ級を超えたギガ級を……さらにもう一つ越えたテラ級だ！</sup><br><sup>--this is...beyond megabytes of giga...beyond one more terraweight!</sup></p>
<p id="L19"><br></p>
<p id="L20">It means you can do these things and stuff!<br><sup>こういうのとか、そういうことができるってことだ！</sup><br><sup>I mean, you can do this or that!</sup></p>
<p id="L21"><br></p>
<p id="L22">"No, ......, I'm not teaching you magic that makes you do that, okay?<br><sup>『いや……そういうことをさせる魔法を教えるのではないぞ？』</sup><br><sup>'No... you're not going to teach me magic to make me do that?'</sup></p>
<p id="L23">"What?　Oh, no!"<br><sup>「ッ！？　え、違うの！？」</sup><br><sup>"What!? Oh, no!"</sup></p>
<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25">My secret plan was dismissed by Traina as if she were dumbfounded.<br><sup>俺の密かな企みを、トレイナは呆れたように否定した。</sup><br><sup>Trina flatly denied my secret plan.</sup></p>
<p id="L26"><br></p>
<p id="L27"><br></p>
<p id="L28">I'm not sure if you'll be able to do that, but I'm sure you'll be able to do it.<br><sup>『なぜなら……今の貴様は魔呼吸で魔法の連射はできるようになったが、今の貴様の魔力容量では……テラ級は『まだ』使えんしな』</sup><br><sup>'Because... you can shoot magic continuously with magical breathing, but with your current magical capacity... you can't use terra-grade yet.'</sup></p>
<p id="L29"><br></p>
<p id="L30">"It's ....... It's .......<br><sup>「……あっ……」</sup><br><sup>"...oh..."</sup></p>
<p id="L31"><br></p>
<p id="L32">I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one who has a problem with that.<br><sup>『一応余もカクレテールで貴様にギガ級の魔法を教えようかとも思ったが、威力やこれまでの経験からも、ギガ級規模の力なら大魔螺旋を磨いた方が良いしな』</sup><br><sup>"I was going to teach you giga magic in Kakretail, but from my power and experience, I think it's better to polish the devil's spiral if it's a giga-scale power."</sup></p>
<p id="L33"><br></p>
<p id="L34">".................."<br><sup>「………………」</sup><br><sup>「………………」</sup></p>
<p id="L35"><br></p>
<p id="L36">I'm not sure if you'll be able to do it, but I'm sure you'll be able to do it.<br><sup>『仮にギガ級を習得しても、今の貴様の感覚では『発動できても持て余す』ので、順序を経てからとしようと考えている』</sup><br><sup>"Even if you learn giga, you can't hold it even if you can, so I'm thinking of doing it after the order."</sup></p>
<p id="L37"><br></p>
<p id="L38"><br></p>
<p id="L39">Traina told me in a rather meaningful way that I simply didn't have enough magic power, or that I couldn't hold it with my current senses.<br><sup>単純に俺の魔力が足りなかったり、今の俺の感覚では持て余すという、ちょっと意味深な言葉をトレイナは告げた。</sup><br><sup>Trina said a little meaningful words that I simply lacked my magical powers or that I couldn't handle them now.</sup></p>
<p id="L40">I can't do terra-grade, but I can do giga-grade, right?　But the fact that I don't have the necessary senses is ......<br><sup>テラ級は無理でも、ギガ級なら今の俺でも発動はできる？　でも、必要な感覚が無いっていうのは……</sup><br><sup>Even if I can't do terra-grade, can I activate it now if it's giga-grade?But I don't feel necessary...</sup></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42"><br></p>
<p id="L43">But I can't say I don't understand your delusion.　The first time I faced Hiiro and the other seven heroes, they were so astounded by my magic that they lost their minds. It's a good idea to have a good idea of what you're going to be doing and how you're going to do it.<br><sup>『まあしかし、貴様の妄想も気持ちが分からんでもないぞ？　余とて、かつてヒイロたち七勇者と初対決したときなど、奴らは余の魔法に度肝を抜かれて腰を抜かしおったからなぁ。そんな奴らに、『今のはただのビット級だ』みたいなことを言ってやり、奴らが顔面蒼白したときは快感だった』</sup><br><sup>'But your delusion and your feelings don't understand.For when I had my first confrontation with the Seven Heroes, they were frightened out of their wits by the magic.I told them something like, 'That's just a bit of a class,' and I felt good when they turned pale.'</sup></p>
<p id="L44"><br></p>
<p id="L45">"...... Well, you're not that far off the mark, are you ......?<br><sup>「……そ、そんなにあんた、桁外れだったのか……」</sup><br><sup>"... well, you were so out of the ordinary..."</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">"Next time we spar in the dream world, I'll show you my magic.<br><sup>『今度、夢の世界でスパーリングした時に余の魔法を見せてやろう』</sup><br><sup>"Next time I spar in my dream world, I'll show you my magic."</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">"No, I got to see a lot of that when we first met!<br><sup>「いや、それは、出会って最初の頃の方にいっぱい見せてもらったし！？」</sup><br><sup>"No, I had a lot of people show me that when I first met them!"</sup></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51">It's different now than it was then. You'll be able to see the difference between the two. I'm sure you'll be able to figure out what's going on," he said.<br><sup>『あの時と今ではまた違う。貴様は余の助力ありとはいえ、六覇を退けるほど強くなった。今の貴様なら……いや、今の貴様だからこそ、余の魔法の凄さがより具体的に分かるかもしれんしなぁ』</sup><br><sup>"It's different then and now.Although you have a lot of help, you have become strong enough to defeat the Six Hegemony.If you are now... No, it's because you are now that you may understand the greatness of the magic."</sup></p>
<p id="L52"><br></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54">When I first met her, I could only say, "I don't know, but she's amazing.<br><sup>言われてみて、確かに出会った頃の俺はトレイナとの実力差があり過ぎて「よく分かんねーけどすごい」としか言えなかった。</sup><br><sup>"After being told, when I met him, I was definitely so different from Trina that I could only say ""I'm not sure, but it's amazing."""</sup></p>
<p id="L55">But now that I'm a little stronger, I might be able to understand how "great" Traina is.<br><sup>でも、多少なりとも強くなった今の俺なら、トレイナのことを「どれぐらいすごい」かも分かるかもしれねーってことか。</sup><br><sup>But now that I'm a little stronger, I might understand how amazing Trina is.</sup></p>
<p id="L56">I felt a little embarrassed, as if I was being complimented in a roundabout way.<br><sup>何だか遠回しで褒められているような気がして、ちょっと照れ臭かった。</sup><br><sup>I felt a little shy because I felt like I was being praised indirectly.</sup></p>
<p id="L57"><br></p>
<p id="L58">"And with an increased sense of ...... magic, we will be able to understand it more deeply. ......<br><sup>『そして……魔法に対する感覚の向上で、もっとより深く理解できるようになる……』</sup><br><sup>'And... by improving my sense of magic, I can understand it more deeply...'</sup></p>
<p id="L59">"Nuh-uh. ......"<br><sup>「ぬっ、むぅ……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, well..."</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">So you could say it's training that will help you understand Traina more deeply.<br><sup>トレイナをもっと深く理解できるようなトレーニングとも言えるわけか。</sup><br><sup>It can be said that training can help you understand Trainer more deeply.</sup></p>
<p id="L62">I see.<br><sup>なるほどな。</sup><br><sup>I see.</sup></p>
<p id="L63">I thought it was kind of funny, so I laughed too.<br><sup>ちょっと面白そうだなと思い、俺も笑った。</sup><br><sup>I laughed because I thought it would be a little interesting.</sup></p>
<p id="L64">Besides ......<br><sup>それに……</sup><br><sup>And...</sup></p>
<p id="L65"><br></p>
<p id="L66">In addition, ...... the next destination is ...... the site of Sisonotami, which was once called the holy place of magic on earth.<br><sup>『それに……せっかく次の目的地は……かつて地上の魔道の聖地とも呼ばれた、シソノータミの跡地……だしな』</sup><br><sup>"And... the next destination is... the site of Shisonotami, which was once called the sacred place of the magical road on earth... but..."</sup></p>
<p id="L67">"Oh, ......."<br><sup>「あ……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh..."</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">I didn't try to ask too many details from him, but he told me.<br><sup>あんまり俺から細かいことを聞こうとはしなかったけど、こいつの方から言ってきた。</sup><br><sup>He didn't really want to hear the details from me, but he told me.</sup></p>
<p id="L70">A city that Traina once destroyed with her own hands. Sadis's hometown. The place where Sadis lost everything.<br><sup>かつてトレイナが自らの手で滅ぼした都市。サディスの故郷。サディスが全てを失った地。</sup><br><sup>a city once destroyed by Trina herself.Sadis' hometown.the land where Sadis lost everything.</sup></p>
<p id="L71">But I didn't have the right to say anything about what happened in the war, and I didn't want to make things awkward with this guy because of that, so I just dropped the subject. ......<br><sup>でも、戦争で起こった時のことを、俺がとやかく言う資格もないし、そんなんでこいつと気まずくなりたくもないから話題を逸らしていたんだけどな……</sup><br><sup>But I don't have the right to complain about the time of the war, and I don't want to feel awkward with him, so I was diverting from the subject...</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">"Oh, well, ...... are the ruins deep beneath the land, right?　That's what you want to see."<br><sup>「あ～、そういや……その土地の地下深くにある遺跡……だっけ？　あんたが見たいのは」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, no... the ruins deep underground in the land... was it?"What you want to see is..."</sup></p>
<p id="L74">I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it. ...<br><sup>『うむ。奥深くに果て無く続いた遺跡……最深部は余すらも入ることができなかったが……パリピがそこへと通ずる鍵を提供するとのことだしな……』</sup><br><sup>'Well, the ruins that went on endlessly deep... I couldn't even get in the deepest part... but Parisi will provide the key to get there...'</sup></p>
<p id="L75">"............ what's there?"<br><sup>「…………何があるんだ？」</sup><br><sup>"…………what's there?"</sup></p>
<p id="L76">I don't know. I'd like to see it because it's bothering me. ...... That's all. I'm just curious about some things.<br><sup>『分からん。それが気になるから見てみたい……それだけだ。ちょっと気になることもあるしな』</sup><br><sup>'I don't know. I'm curious about that, so I'd like to see it... that's all.There's something I'm a little curious about.'</sup></p>
<p id="L77">"What's on your mind?<br><sup>「気になること？」</sup><br><sup>"What do you care about?"</sup></p>
<p id="L78">It seems that both the Parisians and the Yamidire have set foot in the ruins more or less since my death. ...... I wonder what has become of the things I once sealed away.<br><sup>『パリピもヤミディレも、余の死後は多少なりとも遺跡に足を踏み入れていたようだしな……余がかつて封印したものが……どうなっているかもな』</sup><br><sup>'Paripi and Yamidile seem to have set foot on the ruins at least a little after their death... what happened to what we had sealed before?'</sup></p>
<p id="L79"><br></p>
<p id="L80">What should I do? ...... You've brought up the topic yourself, can I ask you something deeper? ...... I mean, when I think of it like that... ...<br><sup>どうしよう……自分から話題を振ってきてるんだし、深く聞いてもいいんだろうか……っていうか、そうやって俺が思った時点で……</sup><br><sup>What should I do... I'm starting to talk about it myself, and I wonder if I can ask you deeply... or when I think so...</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">I don't care.<br><sup>『かまわんぞ』</sup><br><sup>"I don't care,"</sup></p>
<p id="L83">"There it is: ......<br><sup>「あっ……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh..."</sup></p>
<p id="L84"><br></p>
<p id="L85">You can't know what's going on. ......<br><sup>筒抜けなわけで……</sup><br><sup>It's out of the ordinary...</sup></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">I don't care what you say. I'm sure you're not the only one.<br><sup>『聞いて構わん。どのみちこれから余が見るもの聞くもの全ては貴様と一緒なわけだからな』</sup><br><sup>"I don't mind asking.for everything I see and hear is with you anyway.'</sup></p>
<p id="L88"><br></p>
<p id="L89">Then Traina laughed, as if to say, "Ask me anything.<br><sup>そう言って、トレイナは何でも聞けという様子で笑った。</sup><br><sup>Trina laughed as if she were asking for anything.</sup></p>
<p id="L90"><br></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">"Hey there, brother, did you catch anything?"<br><sup>「おーい、そこの兄ちゃん、何か釣れたかい？」</sup><br><sup>"Hey, brother, did you catch anything?"</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94">"Tsou: ......<br><sup>「つぉ……」</sup><br><sup>"Well..."</sup></p>
<p id="L95"><br></p>
<p id="L96"><br></p>
<p id="L97">We were in the middle of a conversation, but we were on a boat. Naturally, there are other people here.<br><sup>と、話の最中だったが、ここは船の上だ。当然、他にも人が居る。</sup><br><sup>I was in the middle of a conversation, but this is on board.Of course, there are other people.</sup></p>
<p id="L98">I had been standing on one leg all morning, fishing conspicuously, and the huge old sailors who lent me their fishing rods smiled at me and talked to me.<br><sup>朝からずっと片足立ちで釣りをして目立っていた俺に、釣り竿を貸してくれた巨漢の船乗りのおっさんたちが笑みを浮かべながら話しかけてきた。</sup><br><sup>The great sailors who lent me their fishing rods smiled and talked to me, who had been standing on one leg all morning.</sup></p>
<p id="L99"><br></p>
<p id="L100">"Oh, no, I'm not catching any ......."<br><sup>「あ、いや……釣れてねえっす……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, no... I can't catch it..."</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">This is just part of the training, and whether you can catch it or not is secondary to the fact that you can't catch it. ...... I tried to make excuses, but there were times when I was just plain stubborn and couldn't catch anything, so I answered honestly.<br><sup>これはあくまで修行の一環であり、釣れるか釣れないかは二の次である……みたいな言い訳しようにも、普通にガチで釣れなかったこともあったので、俺は素直に答えた。</sup><br><sup>This was just part of my training, and even if I made excuses like whether I could catch it or not, I couldn't catch it normally, so I answered honestly.</sup></p>
<p id="L103"><br></p>
<p id="L104">"Hahahaha, I've been at it since this morning and I'm so pathetic!<br><sup>「だはははは、朝からやってボウズは情けねーな～」</sup><br><sup>"Haha, do it in the morning and Bowes is pathetic~"</sup></p>
<p id="L105">"Is this by any chance your first time fishing?　All right, I'll teach you, okay?"<br><sup>「ひょっとして、釣りは初めてか？　よし、おっちゃんが教えてやろうか？」</sup><br><sup>"Is this your first time fishing?"Okay, shall Grandpa teach you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L106">"Here, give me your rod."<br><sup>「ほれ、竿を貸してみな」</sup><br><sup>"Come on, lend me a pole."</sup></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">The old sailors were patting me on the head in a familiar manner. To be honest, I'm in the middle of my training and would prefer to be left alone, but I don't feel comfortable behaving badly just because I'm ...... there, so I just gave them a friendly smile and a malapropism.<br><sup>馴れ馴れしく俺の頭をポンポン叩いてくる船乗りのおっさんたち。正直、修行の最中なので放っておいて欲しいんだけど……だからって悪い態度を取るのも気が引けるし、とりあえず相槌して愛想笑いした。</sup><br><sup>Sailors patting me on the head with familiarity.To be honest, I'm in the middle of training, so I want you to leave me alone... but I don't feel like behaving badly, and for the time being, I agreed and laughed amiably.</sup></p>
<p id="L109"><br></p>
<p id="L110">"Noooo ......, you're interrupting me while I'm talking to a child. ......<br><sup>『ぬぅ……余が童と話しているというのに邪魔をしおって……』</sup><br><sup>'Well... I'm interrupting you even though I'm talking to a child...'</sup></p>
<p id="L111"><br></p>
<p id="L112">I'm not sure if she thought she was interfering with my training or not, but she looked kind of pissed and sulky.<br><sup>トレイナもトレーニング邪魔されたと思ったのか、何だかむくれて拗ねた表情。</sup><br><sup>Trina's expression was kind of sulky and upset, perhaps because she thought she was interrupted.</sup></p>
<p id="L113">This demon king is amazing, but sometimes he's a bit childish. ......<br><sup>ったく、この魔王はスゲーのに、たまに子供っぽい所があるというか……</sup><br><sup>Well, this demon king is amazing, but sometimes he's childish...</sup></p>
<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115"><br></p>
<p id="L116">"So, are you alone, brother?　You're a young man, but you're tough enough to go on a boat trip by yourself.<br><sup>「でよぉ、兄ちゃんは一人か？　若ぇのに一人で船旅とは逞しいじゃねえか」</sup><br><sup>"Well, is your brother alone?"It's strong to travel alone, isn't it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L117"><br></p>
<p id="L118">"Uh, yeah, well, is that so?"<br><sup>「ん、あ、まあ、そうすか？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, well, is that so?"</sup></p>
<p id="L119"><br></p>
<p id="L120">"Are you traveling?　Where are you going?"<br><sup>「旅行かい？　どこに行くんでい？」</sup><br><sup>"Travel? Where are you going?"</sup></p>
<p id="L121"><br></p>
<p id="L122"><br></p>
<p id="L123">I was asked about my destination in the course of the conversation. Well, I guess there's nothing to hide, so I'll just be honest: ......<br><sup>話の流れで聞かれた目的地。まぁ、別に隠すことでもないだろうから素直に……</sup><br><sup>a destination heard in the course of a story.Well, it won't be anything to hide, so be honest...</sup></p>
<p id="L124"><br></p>
<p id="L125"><br></p>
<p id="L126">"I was thinking of going to the old magic city ...... called Sisonotami.<br><sup>「旧魔導都市……シソノータミってのに行ってみようと思ってな」</sup><br><sup>"The old magical city... I'm going to go to Shisonotami."</sup></p>
<p id="L127"><br></p>
<p id="L128">"What the hell?<br><sup>「「「ッッ！？」」」</sup><br><sup>"'Huh!'"</sup></p>
<p id="L129"><br></p>
<p id="L130"><br></p>
<p id="L131">The old sailors reacted a bit to my words. Well, the name Shishonotami itself is famous.<br><sup>俺の言葉に船乗りのおっさんたちはちょっと反応を見せる。まぁ、シソノータミの名前自体は有名だしな。</sup><br><sup>The sailors reacted a little to my words.Well, the name of the shisonotami itself is famous.</sup></p>
<p id="L132">No, or did they suspect you?<br><sup>いや、それとも怪しまれたか？</sup><br><sup>No, or did you get suspicious?</sup></p>
<p id="L133">If you think about it, a kid like me is ...... in a land that seems to have already been destroyed more than a decade ago.<br><sup>よくよく考えれば、既に十数年前に滅んだような土地に、俺みたいなガキが……</sup><br><sup>If you think about it carefully, there's a kid like me on a land that's already been destroyed more than a decade ago...</sup></p>
<p id="L134"><br></p>
<p id="L135">"There is now ......."<br><sup>「あそこって今……」</sup><br><sup>"That's right there..."</sup></p>
<p id="L136">"Oh, yeah. ......"<br><sup>「おお、だよな……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that's right..."</sup></p>
<p id="L137"><br></p>
<p id="L138">The old sailors nodded at each other, as if something was bothering them about my words.<br><sup>と、俺の言葉に対して何か気になることがあったようで、船乗りのおっさんたちが頷き合った。</sup><br><sup>The sailors nodded to each other, as if they were curious about my words.</sup></p>
<p id="L139">What the hell is that?<br><sup>一体、何が？</sup><br><sup>What the hell is going on?</sup></p>
<p id="L140"><br></p>
<p id="L141">"I'm told that the imperial highness is visiting with the demon highness for a joint investigation.<br><sup>「帝国のお偉いさんが、魔族のお偉いさんと合同調査のために訪問してるって話だ」</sup><br><sup>"It is said that the great men of the Empire are visiting with the great men of the demons for a joint investigation."</sup></p>
<p id="L142">"...... what?"<br><sup>「……なに？」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L143">"There was an advisory a few days ago that the big man would be taking a ship through this route, so we had to be careful not to block it.<br><sup>「数日前に、そのお偉いさんが船でこの航路を通るから、遮ったりしないように気を付けろって勧告があったしな」</sup><br><sup>"A few days ago, the great man was advised not to block him, for he was going by boat."</sup></p>
<p id="L144">"Oh, really, ......?"<br><sup>「そ、そうなのか……？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, really..."</sup></p>
<p id="L145"><br></p>
<p id="L146">I didn't know there was such an event. Well, I've been isolated from the outside world for the past three months, so I'm a little out of the loop too. ......<br><sup>そんなイベントがあったなんて知らなかった。まぁ、この三か月間は外界と隔離されてたから俺も情報に少し疎くなっているんだけども……</sup><br><sup>I didn't know there was such an event.Well, I've been isolated from the outside world for the past three months, so I'm a little out of touch with information...</sup></p>
<p id="L147"><br></p>
<p id="L148">"Yeah, that was a pretty big story, huh?　The Imperial Fleet was escorting us through the route this ship is taking right now."<br><sup>「ああ、結構大きな話だったぜ？　今この船が通ってる航路を、帝国艦隊に護衛されて通ってたんだからな」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, it was a pretty big story, wasn't it?I was escorted by the Imperial Fleet along the route on which this ship was passing."</sup></p>
<p id="L149"><br></p>
<p id="L150">In the event that you're looking for the best way to get the most out of your business, then you're in the right place.<br><sup>しかも艦隊って……まぁ、相手が魔族のお偉いさんなら、昔のことを根に持ったどっかの輩が襲い掛かるとも分からんしな。</sup><br><sup>And a fleet... well, if the other person is a great man of the demons, I don't know if someone with the roots of the past will attack him.</sup></p>
<p id="L151">So my dad and mom skipped out on that job. ...... I guess I'm fired?　It's my fault. ......<br><sup>つか、親父と母さんはその仕事をサボってたわけか……クビかな？　俺の所為なんだけど……</sup><br><sup>Or maybe my father and mother skipped the job... was it fired?It's my fault...</sup></p>
<p id="L152"><br></p>
<p id="L153"><br></p>
<p id="L154">"And that time, the person in charge of the Empire side was a hero known to everyone in the world!<br><sup>「それに、あの時は帝国側の責任者様が世界の誰もが知る英雄様だったもんな！」</sup><br><sup>"And at that time, the head of the Empire was a hero known to everyone in the world!"</sup></p>
<p id="L155"><br></p>
<p id="L156">"Yes. After all, he's one of the seven heroes!　It's a big deal because it's the Great Mage Ben Rinnah!<br><sup>「そう。なんてったって、あの七勇者の一人！　『大魔導士・ベンリナーフ』様なんだから、そりゃ大ごとさ！」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, one of those seven brave men!"Mr. Benlinarf, the Great Wizard, so that's a big deal!"</sup></p>

<p id="L158"><br></p>
<p id="L159">...... hmm?<br><sup>……ん？</sup><br><sup>...huh?</sup></p>

<p id="L164">"Nunu: ......<br><sup>『ぬぬ……』</sup><br><sup>'Nu...'</sup></p>
<p id="L165"><br></p>
<p id="L166"><br></p>
<p id="L167">I couldn't help but gush over the name that I had heard so much about and used to see so often.<br><sup>その、あまりにも聞いたことあり過ぎるというか、昔はよく会っていた名前に俺は思わず噴き出した。</sup><br><sup>Well, I've heard too much of it, or rather, I burst out laughing at the name I used to see a lot.</sup></p>
<p id="L168">Traina also frowned.<br><sup>トレイナも眉を顰めた。</sup><br><sup>Trina frowned, too.</sup></p>
<p id="L169"><br></p>
<p id="L170">"Oh?　Do you know your brother?"<br><sup>「お？　流石に兄ちゃんも知ってるかい？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh? Do you know that, as expected?"</sup></p>
<p id="L171">"Were you born after the war, brother?　Well, at least you know about the seven heroes."<br><sup>「兄ちゃんは戦争の後の生まれかい？　まっ、それでも七勇者ぐらいは知ってるか」</sup><br><sup>"Was your brother born after the war?"Oh, but do you know about the Seven Braves?"</sup></p>
<p id="L172">"When we were young, we were the heroes of the world.<br><sup>「俺らの若いころは、そりゃーもう、ヒーローそのものだったからよ～」</sup><br><sup>"When we were young, of course, it was because we were heroes themselves~"</sup></p>
<p id="L173"><br></p>
<p id="L174">If I told these old men that the parents who gave birth to me are the same way, they would be surprised. ...... I mean, they wouldn't believe me.<br><sup>このおっさんたちに、俺を産んだ両親もそうなんだと言ったら驚くだろうな……つか、信じねえだろうな。</sup><br><sup>You'd be surprised if you told these guys that the parents who gave birth to me were the same... or you wouldn't believe it.</sup></p>
<p id="L175">And that grand mage, he's my childhood friend's father. ......<br><sup>そして、その大魔導士、俺の幼馴染の親父さんなんだけどな……</sup><br><sup>And that wizard is my childhood friend's father...</sup></p>
<p id="L176"><br></p>
<p id="L177">"Oh, I see. ...... Those seven heroes are escorted by ......."<br><sup>「へぇ、そうか……あの七勇者様が護衛で……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, I see... that seven brave men are guards..."</sup></p>
<p id="L178">"Yeah. I'm not sure what to make of it, but I think it's a good idea.<br><sup>「ああ。あの七勇者が数日前に通った航路を俺らも通るとか、よくよく考えると何だか嬉しいぜ！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, I'm glad to think that we're going to take the route that the Seven Brave took a few days ago!"</sup></p>
<p id="L179"><br></p>
<p id="L180">Then the old men rubbed the bridge of their noses with their fingers happily.<br><sup>そう言って、嬉しそうに指で鼻の下を擦るおっさんたち。</sup><br><sup>The old men rubbed their noses happily with their fingers.</sup></p>
<p id="L181">But I didn't think it was supposed to be like that.<br><sup>しかし、まさかそんなことになってたとはな。</sup><br><sup>But I can't believe that happened.</sup></p>
<p id="L182">Well, I don't dislike that guy because he's not unnecessarily nervous when you meet him like the Emperor, or uptight like Rival's father, but he's always smiling and kind like a big brother. I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not.<br><sup>まぁ、皇帝陛下みたいに会うと無駄に緊張したり、リヴァルの父ちゃんみたいに堅物じゃなくて、いつもニコニコした優しい兄ちゃんみたいな感じであの人は嫌いじゃないけど、最近は全然会ってね～からな～……つか、もし遭遇したらまずいんじゃねぇのか？</sup><br><sup>Well, I don't hate him because he's unnecessarily nervous when I see him like His Majesty the Emperor, or because he's not as hard as Rival's father, but I don't hate him at all these days~... or if I encounter him, wouldn't it be bad?</sup></p>
<p id="L183"><br></p>
<p id="L184">"Oh, I see, that happened a few days ago. Anyway, did you have any problems?"<br><sup>「あ～、つか、数日前にそんなことがあったんだな。とりあえず、問題はなかったんすか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, well, that happened a few days ago.Wasn't there any problem?"</sup></p>
<p id="L185">"Well, you know. I'm not going to attack anyone, and I don't want to cause any trouble. No matter how many lives I have, it won't be enough.<br><sup>「まぁな。つか、誰も襲うわけもねーし、トラブルなんて起こしたくねーもんさ。命がいくつあっても足りねえしな」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I don't want anyone to attack me, and I don't want to cause trouble.It's not enough to have as many lives as you want."</sup></p>
<p id="L186">"Ha, I see."<br><sup>「はは、そりゃそうか」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I see,"</sup></p>
<p id="L187">"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but it's a good idea.<br><sup>「おうよ。なんせ大魔導士様だけじゃなく、そもそも護衛されてた魔族のお偉いさんが……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, not only the great magician, but also the great magician who was escorted in the first place..."</sup></p>
<p id="L188"><br></p>
<p id="L189">I smiled bitterly, and the old man nodded.<br><sup>苦笑する俺と、それに頷くおっさん。</sup><br><sup>Me smiling bitterly and my uncle nodding.</sup></p>
<p id="L190">However, it followed from the mouth of such an old man: ......<br><sup>しかし、そんなおっさんの口から続いて……</sup><br><sup>But from that old man's mouth...</sup></p>
<p id="L191"><br></p>
<p id="L192"><br></p>
<p id="L193">"I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'm sure it's worth it.<br><sup>「なんせあの……六覇の『幼女闘将』だってんだからよ～」</sup><br><sup>"Well... it's because he's the Six Hegemonic 'Children's Fighter~"</sup></p>
<p id="L194"><br></p>
<p id="L195">"What?<br><sup>『うなっ！？』</sup><br><sup>'What!'</sup></p>
<p id="L196"><br></p>
<p id="L197">"BFF?<br><sup>「ぼふっ？！」</sup><br><sup>"Huh?!</sup></p>
<p id="L198"><br></p>
<p id="L199"><br></p>
<p id="L200">I was so surprised that I erupted again, but I'm sure Traina was even more surprised. ...... No, ...... What?　Wait a minute. ......<br><sup>俺も再び噴き出すほど驚いたが、トレイナに至ってはもっとだろう……いや……え？　ちょっと待てよ……</sup><br><sup>I was so surprised that I burst out laughing again, but I guess it's more to Trina... no... what?Wait a minute...</sup></p>
<p id="L201"><br></p>
<p id="L202"><br></p>
<p id="L203">We were training for a leisurely, slow journey together, right?<br><sup>のんびりゆっくりの二人旅をしながらの修行だったよな？</sup><br><sup>It was training while traveling slowly and slowly, right?</sup></p>
<p id="L204"><br></p>
<p id="L205"><br></p>
<p id="L206">Why do I have a bad feeling about this even before we land?<br><sup>なんで上陸する前から嫌な予感がするんだ？</sup><br><sup>Why do you have a bad feeling even before you land?</sup></p>
<p id="L207"><br></p>
<p id="L208"><br></p>
<p id="L209">Please, I'm so full of it, ...... don't let anything extra happen for a while!<br><sup>頼むから、もうお腹いっぱいだから……余計なことはしばらく起きないでくれ！！</sup><br><sup>For God's sake, I'm already full... Don't let unnecessary things happen for a while!!</sup></p>
