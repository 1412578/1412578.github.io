<p id="L6">In the meantime, I'll let the prince beside me use his magic first.<br><sup>その隙に、まずは俺の傍らの王子に魔法を使わせる。</sup><br><sup>In the meantime, I'll let the prince beside me use magic.</sup></p>

<p id="L12">But if this magic is an "attack" directed at my dad or mom, then they'll be focused on the "battle" again. ......<br><sup>もっとも、この魔法がそれこそ親父や母さんに向けられる「攻撃」ならば二人はまた「戦闘」を意識して集中するんだろうけど……</sup><br><sup>However, if this magic is directed at your father and mother, they will concentrate on fighting again...</sup></p>

<p id="L25">And there is no malice or hostility in it, no poison or attack.<br><sup>ましてや、それに毒とか攻撃とかの悪意や敵意もない。</sup><br><sup>Moreover, there is no ill will or hostility of poison or attack.</sup></p>
<p id="L26">Amae is excited, but my dad and mom can't help but be confused by this change in environment.<br><sup>アマエは興奮してるが、親父も母さんもこの環境の変化に戸惑うしかない。</sup><br><sup>Amae is excited, but both her father and mother have no choice but to be confused by the change in the environment.</sup></p>

<p id="L28">In fact ......<br><sup>実際……</sup><br><sup>Actually...</sup></p>
<p id="L29"><br></p>
<p id="L30">'It doesn't make any sense. But from two people whose concentration was disturbed, it would be even more confusing. What's the point ...... in making them think that. In addition, the two of them who are passive from the start, without any attack from the other side to take care of the child, can not do anything.

It's meaningful to make you think so.Moreover, the two of them, who were in a passive state from the beginning, could not do anything because they were worried about the child and did not attack him.Hmmm, passive Hiro and Maam?This is the least appropriate strategy for you idiots who used only single-celled tactics such as charge special attack crushing.Everything is behind you.Hi... Maam!"</sup></p>
<p id="L31"><br></p>
<p id="L32">Yeah, there's no point. This is just another thing that will confuse both my dad and mom.<br><sup>そう、意味なんてない。これも親父と母さんの二人をただ混乱させるだけのこと。</sup><br><sup>Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.This is just confusing my father and mother.</sup></p>
<p id="L33">However, from here: ......<br><sup>ただし、ここからは……</sup><br><sup>But from now on...</sup></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35"><br></p>
<p id="L36">"My concentration is disrupted, and I'm right in front of you, and you can't even look away this easily. ......

<p id="L41">At that moment, I ran straight towards them, feeling as if Traina's words had pushed me out of the way.<br><sup>その瞬間、トレイナの言葉で背中を押し出されたような気持になりながら、俺は二人へ向かって真っすぐ走った。</sup><br><sup>At that moment, I ran straight to them, feeling as if my back had been pushed out by Trina's words.</sup></p>

<p id="L45"><br></p>
<p id="L46">I, who had been running away from them for so long, ran towards them.<br><sup>さんざん逃げ回っていた俺が、二人めがけて走る。</sup><br><sup>I was running around a lot, but I ran for them.</sup></p>
<p id="L47">They looked at me in a panic and for a moment I tried to brace myself in case they were going to attack from me ...... but ......<br><sup>慌てて二人は俺を見て、一瞬だけ俺から攻撃されるかもしれないと思って身構えようとした……だけど……</sup><br><sup>They looked at me in a hurry and tried to get ready for a moment because they thought I might attack them... but...</sup></p>

<p id="L49">"What, ......?"<br><sup>「「え……？」」</sup><br><sup>"'What...?'"</sup></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51">Here, they must have been even more surprised again.<br><sup>ここで、二人はまた更に驚いたはずだ。</sup><br><sup>Now they must have been even more surprised.</sup></p>
<p id="L52">Because I didn't feel any sign of an attack as I ran straight ahead.<br><sup>何故なら、真っすぐ走る俺から何の攻撃の気配も感じなかったからだ。</sup><br><sup>Because I didn't feel any signs of attack.</sup></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>

<p id="L55">"...... Surge?"<br><sup>「……突進？」</sup><br><sup>"... dash?"</sup></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">This delayed their reaction again.<br><sup>これによって、二人の反応はまた遅れる。</sup><br><sup>As a result, their reaction will be delayed again.</sup></p>

<p id="L59">"Now you can get out of ......!<br><sup>『今なら……抜ける！』</sup><br><sup>'Now... I'm out!'</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">If you don't even attack, what am I running towards you two for?<br><sup>攻撃もしないなら、俺は何のために二人へ向かって走る？</sup><br><sup>If you don't attack me, what am I running for?</sup></p>
<p id="L62">The right answer is radically different.<br><sup>正解は、根本から違う。</sup><br><sup>The answer is fundamentally different.</sup></p>
<p id="L63">I'm not running towards you two.<br><sup>俺は二人に向かって走っているわけではない。</sup><br><sup>I'm not running toward them.</sup></p>
<p id="L64">The two of them are simply standing in front of me as an obstacle as I run.<br><sup>単純に俺が走る先に、『障害』として二人が立っているだけ。</sup><br><sup>Just where I run, they're standing as obstacles.</sup></p>
<p id="L65">My goal is to get to my sister, who is standing behind them, chomping at the bit.<br><sup>俺が目指すのは、二人の後ろにチョコンと立っている妹。</sup><br><sup>My goal is my sister standing behind them.</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">If you use breakthroughs, the two of you will be aware of combat ......, so don't use them. What you need here is not physical ability, but the skill and quality of ...... running!<br><sup>『ブレイクスルーを使ってしまえば、二人は戦闘を意識する……だから、使うな。ここで必要なのは身体能力ではなく……走りの技術と質だ！』</sup><br><sup>'If you use breakthroughs, they'll be conscious of fighting... so don't use them.What we need here is not physical ability... but running skills and quality!"</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">Yes, I'm not running to attack. It's to get past them and get to Amae.<br><sup>そう、俺が走るのは攻撃のためじゃない。二人を抜いてアマエの所に辿り着くためのもの。</sup><br><sup>Yeah, I'm not running because of the attack.It's to get to Amae by overtaking them.</sup></p>
<p id="L70">I'm in a situation right now where my concentration is disrupted, my eyes are averted, and I can't think straight. ......<br><sup>集中力乱され、視線も逸らされ、頭の整理もできない今の状況で……</sup><br><sup>In the current situation where my concentration is disturbed, my eyes are turned away, and I can't organize my head...</sup></p>

<p id="L78">He slowed his pace just before dashing into the distance between the two of them.<br><sup>ダッシュで二人の間合いに入る寸前にペースに緩急をつける。</sup><br><sup>Just before the dash enters the gap between the two, slow down and speed up.</sup></p>
<p id="L79">Weight shift to the right of ...... from change of pace .......<br><sup>チェンジオブペース……からの……右へ体重移動。</sup><br><sup>Change of pace... from... weight transfer to the right.</sup></p>
<p id="L80"><br></p>
<p id="L81">"Hey, Earth!"<br><sup>「ちょっ、アース！」</sup><br><sup>"Hey, Earth!"</sup></p>
<p id="L82">"What?　Where are you going?"<br><sup>「何を！？　どこへ！？」</sup><br><sup>"What!? Where!"</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">My dad and mom responded, shifting their center of gravity as I moved with them.<br><sup>親父と母さんも反応し、俺の動きに連れられて重心をズラす。</sup><br><sup>My father and mother also react and shift their center of gravity with my movements.</sup></p>
<p id="L85">But there I was, shifting my weight to the right and then cutting back to the left, a crossover step: ......<br><sup>だが、そこで俺は右への体重移動から左への切り返しのクロスオーバーステップ……</sup><br><sup>But there I went from weight transfer to weight transfer to the left.Crossover step...</sup></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">"What?　I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not.<br><sup>「ッ！？　お……おま……ッ、逆移動か！」</sup><br><sup>"Huh!? Oh... oh... oh, it's moving backwards!"</sup></p>
<p id="L88">"This move is ......, wait!　You're not getting away!<br><sup>「この動きは……っ、待ちなさい！　逃がさないわ！」</sup><br><sup>"This movement... wait!I won't let you go!"</sup></p>
<p id="L89"><br></p>
<p id="L90">However, both my father and mother reacted instantly, even though they were surprised by my turning movement.<br><sup>だけど、俺の切り返しの動きを親父も母さんも驚きながらも瞬時に反応。</sup><br><sup>But both my father and mother were surprised and reacted instantly to my turnaround.</sup></p>
<p id="L91">I look away from them for a moment. They both respond to that slight guidance of his gaze.<br><sup>二人から一瞬だけ視線を逸らす。その僅かな視線の誘導にも二人は反応。</sup><br><sup>Look away from them for a moment.They also react to the slight induction of gaze.</sup></p>
<p id="L92">It seems that the two of you are able to keep up with the feinting while being set up so well. ...... but ......<br><sup>これだけお膳立てされながらのフェイントにも、流石に百戦錬磨の二人はついてこれるようだな……だけど……</sup><br><sup>It seems that the two of them, who are trained in 100 battles, can follow Faint as expected... but...</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94"><br></p>
<p id="L95">"From ......!"<br><sup>「……からの～！」</sup><br><sup>"...from!"</sup></p>

<p id="L100"><br></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">Just as my dad and mom reacted and tried to shift their center of gravity with their eyes on the opposite side, I stepped in the opposite direction again and pulled it out in one go.<br><sup>親父と母さんが反応して逆サイドに視線を向けたまま重心移動させようとした瞬間、俺は再び逆へステップし、一気に抜き去る。</sup><br><sup>The moment my father and mother react and try to shift their focus to the opposite side, I step backwards again and pull it out all at once.</sup></p>

<p id="L109"><br></p>
<p id="L110">If this was a step used for combat, ...... two people in a state of concentration, ...... maybe they could have been crushed.<br><sup>これが戦闘に使うステップだったら……二人が集中状態なら……多分、潰されたかもしれない。</sup><br><sup>If this was a step to use in battle... if they were concentrated... they might have been crushed.</sup></p>
<p id="L111">But I pulled it out.<br><sup>でも、俺は抜いた。</sup><br><sup>But I pulled it out.</sup></p>
<p id="L112"><br></p>
<p id="L113">It's not only the ...... double and triple arrangements ...... that make it so.

<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115">Speed, power, that's not all.<br><sup>スピード、パワー、それだけじゃねぇ。</sup><br><sup>Speed, power, that's not all.</sup></p>
<p id="L116"><br></p>
<p id="L117">In the event you're a single-celled idiot, you're usually going to crush them head-on without thinking about their feints and techniques, but ...... you couldn't help but see them.　You've got to be careful not to get caught up in the feinting because the step work ...... of the child is so perfect.<br><sup>『普段なら、相手のフェイントや技術などお構いなしに正面から何も考えずに叩き潰す単細胞馬鹿の貴様らだが……思わず見てしまっただろう？　あまりにも完成度の高い童のステップワーク……ゆえに、フェイントにも引っかかってしまっただろう？』</sup><br><sup>"Usually, you single-celled idiots crush the other person's feints and techniques without thinking about them head-on, didn't you?The step work of a child who is so complete... that he got stuck in the feint, didn't you?"</sup></p>

<p id="L119">I pulled it off with technology. My dad. Mom.<br><sup>技術で抜いた。親父を。母さんを。</sup><br><sup>I pulled it out with technology.My father.My mother.</sup></p>

<p id="L123"><br></p>
<p id="L124">Then they got caught by my feint, couldn't keep up, and their legs got tangled up in the repeated shifting of their weight, and they both fell on their asses on the spot.<br><sup>そして二人は俺のフェイントに引っかかり、付いてこれず、体重移動の繰り返しで足がもつれて、二人まとめてその場で尻餅ついた。</sup><br><sup>Then they got caught in my feint, couldn't keep up, and their legs got tangled up due to repeated weight shifts, and they all fell on their hips on the spot.</sup></p>

<p id="L133">It's a great crossover step.
