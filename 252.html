<p id="L2">Of course, he would know about what I did in the game.<br><sup>当然、御前試合で俺がやらかしたこととかも知っているだろう。</sup><br><sup>Of course you know what I did in your previous game.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">If they are found, they could be caught and deported.<br><sup>見つかったら取っ捕まって、強制送還だってありえる。</sup><br><sup>If found, they could be arrested and deported.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">My dad and mom will hear about it, and I honestly don't want to see them.<br><sup>親父と母さんの耳にも入るだろうし、正直会いたくねえ。</sup><br><sup>I'm sure you'll hear it from your parents, and honestly I don't want to see you.</sup></p>
<p id="L5">And more: ......<br><sup>さらに……</sup><br><sup>What's more...</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7"><br></p>
<p id="L8">"...... children......<br><sup>『……童……』</sup><br><sup>'...child...'</sup></p>

<p id="L10">"Yeah, ......."<br><sup>「うん……」</sup><br><sup>"Yes..."</sup></p>
<p id="L11"><br></p>
<p id="L12">I'm sure you'll be able to figure out the best way to do this. ...<br><sup>『大魔導士と共に行動しているという話の六覇だが……余が認めた将であり、才もあり、有能であり、力もあり……人類にも恐れられていて……』</sup><br><sup>'It's the six hegemony of the story that he's working with the Great Wizard... but he's a general, talented, capable, powerful... feared by mankind...'</sup></p>

<p id="L15"><br></p>
<p id="L16">I'm not sure what to say. Well, he was worthy of the title of Sixth Highest,......, but he was not very good for the education of the children of today,....... I think.<br><sup>『うむ。まぁ、六覇の称号に相応しい者でもあった……が、しかし……その、なんというか……今の童の教育にはあまりよろしくないと思うのだ』</sup><br><sup>'Well, he was also worthy of the title of Six Hegemony... but... well, I don't think he's very kind to the education of children today.'</sup></p>
<p id="L17"><br></p>

<p id="L19">He is one of the Six High Commanders who is working with Uncle Ben as a joint investigation into the ruins, which is also our destination.<br><sup>俺たちの目的地でもある遺跡に合同調査ということで、ベンおじさんと一緒に行動しているという六覇の一人。</sup><br><sup>One of the six hegemony states that he is working with Uncle Ben on a joint investigation into the ruins that are also our destination.</sup></p>

<p id="L21"><br></p>
<p id="L22">"I don't know if there's a better Sixth Heaven than the Yamidire or the Parisian!<br><sup>「つか、ヤミディレといい、パリピといい、もっとマシな六覇はいないのか！？」</sup><br><sup>"Or is there a better six hegemony called Yamidile or Paripi?"</sup></p>
<p id="L23">"From my point of view, the Seven Brave Men are just as bad as you!<br><sup>『余からすれば、七勇者も同じようなものだぞ！？』</sup><br><sup>'The Seven Braves are the same, aren't they?'</sup></p>
<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25">Even so, I've had my fill of legendary warriors lately, having fought in a series of battles with the Six Supremes and encountered my dad and mom.<br><sup>ただでさえ、最近は六覇との連闘だったり、親父と母さんと遭遇したりで、伝説の戦士たちはお腹いっぱいなんだ。</sup><br><sup>These days, the legendary warriors are full of battles with the Six Hegemony and encounters with their father and mothers.</sup></p>
<p id="L26">Both Traina and I hesitated, because we could easily imagine the unpleasantness that would surely ensue if we met.<br><sup>会えば必ず穏やかじゃないことになる展開が容易に想像できるだけに、俺もトレイナも躊躇った。</sup><br><sup>Trina and I hesitated as it was easy to imagine the development that would never be peaceful when we met.</sup></p>
<p id="L27">Then I think again.<br><sup>そして、改めて考える。</sup><br><sup>Then I think again.</sup></p>
<p id="L28">Our destination this time, the former magic city of Sisono-Tami.<br><sup>今回の目的地である旧魔導都市シソノータミ。</sup><br><sup>The former magical city of Shisonotami is this time's destination.</sup></p>

<p id="L30">But now, the new government of the demon world and imperial officials are investigating.<br><sup>しかし、今は魔界新政府と帝国関係者が調査中。</sup><br><sup>However, the new government and imperial officials in the magical world are now investigating.</sup></p>
<p id="L31">So maybe we're not allowed in while they're investigating?<br><sup>なら、ひょっとしたら連中が調査している間は立ち入りできないんじゃ？</sup><br><sup>So maybe you can't get in while they're investigating?"</sup></p>
<p id="L32"><br></p>
<p id="L33">I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to get your hands on one. Here is the magic crystal. ......<br><sup>『うーむ……童……そういえば、例のマスターキーについてだが、パリピは受け取り方法について連絡すると言っていたが、まだ無いな。こちらから魔水晶で……』</sup><br><sup>'Well... child... Come to think of it, about that master key, Paripi said he would contact you about how to receive it, but he hasn't.I'm going to use a magical crystal..."</sup></p>
<p id="L34">"No, I don't want to contact him. ...... I don't know. ...... I don't want to contact him because he might think that I trust him. ......"<br><sup>「いや、こっちから連絡したくねえ……なんとなくだけど……あいつのことだから、こっちから連絡すると、なんか信用してると思われるかもしれねえし、嫌だ……」</sup><br><sup>"No, I don't want to contact you... somehow... I don't want to... if I contact him, he might think I trust him, and I don't want to..."</sup></p>
<p id="L35">"Well, um ......, there's certainly no need to be so hasty ......, given the current situation.<br><sup>『まぁ、うむ……確かに現状を考えると……そんなに急ぐ必要もなぁ……』</sup><br><sup>'Well... certainly, considering the current situation... you don't have to hurry so much...'</sup></p>
<p id="L36"><br></p>
<p id="L37">Yes, Traina is curious about the ruins, but that doesn't mean she's in a hurry.<br><sup>そう、トレイナは遺跡を気になってはいるものの、別にそれは急いでいるわけではない。</sup><br><sup>Yes, Trina is concerned about the ruins, but she is not in a hurry.</sup></p>
<p id="L38"><br></p>
<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">In particular, if there is no master key for the deepest part of the ruins, they will not be able to investigate the depths of the ruins. ...... If you want, you can always go to .......<br><sup>『特に、遺跡最深部はマスターキーが無いのであれば奴らも遺跡の奥底までは調査できぬだろうし……なんならいっそ……』</sup><br><sup>'Especially if the deepest part of the ruins doesn't have a master key, they won't be able to investigate the depths of the ruins... if it's better...'</sup></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42">"Oh, it's better to go to ...... after the interruptions leave."<br><sup>「ああ、邪魔が帰ってからの方が……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, it's better after I get in the way..."</sup></p>
<p id="L43"><br></p>
<p id="L44">"Mm. ......, because there's no need to risk it on an unnecessary errand.<br><sup>『うむ……不要不急の用事でリスクを冒す必要はないからな』</sup><br><sup>'Well... you don't have to take risks on unnecessary and urgent business.'</sup></p>
<p id="L45"><br></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">So, rather than forcing yourself to go and risk running into them, why don't you take your time and relax after they've gone and everything's settled down?<br><sup>そう、無理に行って、連中と遭遇するリスクを冒すよりは、連中が帰って何もかもが落ち着いた後でジックリゆっくりノンビリとした方が？</sup><br><sup>Well, rather than forcing yourself to go and take the risk of encountering them, would you rather sit back and relax after everything settles down?</sup></p>

<p id="L60">That's why we decided to stay in the port town where we arrived for a while.<br><sup>そういうわけで、俺たちは到着した港町に少し滞在することにした。</sup><br><sup>That's why we decided to stay a little longer in the port town where we arrived.</sup></p>

<p id="L83">After a few days on a ship from the DiPercha Empire, we arrived at the Abosua continent.<br><sup>ディパーチャ帝国から船に乗って数日で辿り着いたのは『アボソア大陸』。</sup><br><sup>The Avosoa Continent arrived in a few days by boat from the Departure Empire.</sup></p>
<p id="L84">This is a large continent that has developed from a different cultural formation than the Empire, such as the Kingdom of Jacone, which is also Shinobu's homeland.

<p id="L91">"Yes."<br><sup>「おう」</sup><br><sup>"Oh,"</sup></p>

<p id="L93">With the help of some old sailors, I was able to get a job at a fishing port.<br><sup>船乗りのおっさんたちの口利きで、俺は漁港で仕事をさせてもらっていた。</sup><br><sup>I was allowed to work in a fishing port, mediated by the sailors' old men.</sup></p>

<p id="L97">"I've always eaten ...... fish without thinking about it, but it's a lot of work.

I always ate fish without thinking about it, but it must be hard.If I hadn't worked out in cacletails, I would have been rather tired."</sup></p>
<p id="L98"><br></p>
<p id="L99">"Well, being a fisherman is hard work.<br><sup>『まぁ、漁師というのは重労働だからな』</sup><br><sup>'Well, fishermen are hard work,'</sup></p>

<p id="L101">"You're right, they do have nice muscles. The old fishermen in Kakuretaire were the same way.<br><sup>「たしかに皆いい筋肉してんな。カクレテールの漁師のおっさんたちもそうだったし」</sup><br><sup>"They're all good muscles, to be sure.and so did the fishermen of Cacletail."</sup></p>

<p id="L109">"Because even if you get paid ...... for the day, you'll have to pay for the food, ...... and lodging, ...... and if you buy any extra books, you'll have to pay for the rest of the day. ......"<br><sup>「だってよぉ……一日の報酬貰っても、メシ代と……あと滞在する宿代で消えて……あと、余計な本を買ったりしたら……」</sup><br><sup>"Because... even if I get paid for the day, I'll pay for the food and... and disappear at the hotel charge for my stay... and if I buy unnecessary books..."</sup></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111">"What?　Books are not an afterthought!　Books are a source of knowledge, and there is nothing unnecessary about them!　You should have stayed at a cheaper inn, if that's what you mean!<br><sup>『うなっ？！　ほ、本は余計ではないぞ！　本は知識の源であり、取り入れて不要なものなどないぞ！　だいたい、それを言うなら貴様がもっと安い宿屋に泊まればよかったのだ！』</sup><br><sup>'What?!

<p id="L113">"Because the first inn I saw was shabby, the beds were hard, and the rooms were crusty with black bugs. ......

<p id="L115">"Where did you go with the survival spirit you tried to acquire when you met Aka?<br><sup>『貴様、アカとの出会いで身に付けようとしたサバイバル精神をどこへやった？！』</sup><br><sup>'Where did you put the survival spirit you tried to acquire in your encounter with Aka?'</sup></p>
<p id="L116"><br></p>
<p id="L117">"Oh, ......, I should have registered as a hunter, and I would have been able to kill powerful monsters and bounty hunters and make a fortune. ......"<br><sup>「あ～あ……本来ならハンター登録でもして、強力なモンスターなり賞金首倒してガッポガッポなのに……」</sup><br><sup>"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..."</sup></p>

But now that I've been trained by Traina, I can handle simple tasks without any problems.<br><sup>最初は漁港のおっさんたちも「こんな小僧に大丈夫か？」みたいな感じだったが、トレイナのトレーニングを受けた今の俺は単純な作業だけなら特に問題なくこなせた。</sup><br><sup>At first, the old men at the fishing port were like, "Are you okay with such a boy?"

<p id="L125">If I had any complaint, it was that the wages I was getting for a full day's work were not that much, as I was only doing menial jobs.<br><sup>不満があるとすれば、一日働いても雑用の仕事しかしてない俺が貰える駄賃はそれほどでもないということだった。</sup><br><sup>If I had any complaints, I wouldn't be paid much for doing chores even if I worked all day.</sup></p>

<p id="L141">It was compensation for a day's work, and the moment I received it, even though the amount itself was probably not much, I felt the weight of the bag weighing me down, and at the same time, I felt a sense of contentment.<br><sup>それは一日の労働の対価であり、受け取った瞬間、金額そのものは大したことないはずなのに、その袋にズッシリと重みを感じ、同時に俺は何だか心が満たされるような感じがした。</sup><br><sup>It was the price of a day's labor, and as soon as I received it, the amount of money itself should not be much, but I felt the weight of the bag, and at the same time I felt like my heart was filled.</sup></p>

<p id="L159">That's right. It was the first time I had ever worked and earned money on my own.<br><sup>そう。俺は自分で働いて金を稼ぐのは初めてだったからだ。</sup><br><sup>That's right. It was my first time working and making money.</sup></p>
<p id="L160"><br></p>
<p id="L161">"Hey, don't waste your money, okay?　You'll need money for the journey ahead. It's better to have some savings.<br><sup>『おい、無駄遣いはするでないぞ？　これからの旅にも金は必要になる。貯蓄はあった方が良い』</sup><br><sup>"Hey, don't waste your money.I'll need money for my next trip.It's better to save money.'</sup></p>

<p id="L163"><br></p>
<p id="L164">Work for yourself and earn money. Living on my own money.

<p id="L165"><br></p>
<p id="L166"><br></p>
<p id="L167">And if you think about it, the problem is that you've been empty-handed in your travels so far. It's a good idea to buy some essential items for your journey at a tool store.<br><sup>『それによくよく考えたら、貴様は旅をするにはこれまで手ぶらだったのも問題だ。ここらで旅に必須な『アイテム』なども道具屋で購入した方が良いだろうな』</sup><br><sup>"And, on reflection, it is a problem that you have been empty-handed in your journey.I think it's better to buy items that are essential for traveling here at the tool store."</sup></p>
<p id="L168"><br></p>
<p id="L169">"Hahaha, you're right.

<p id="L170"><br></p>
<p id="L171">When we're done eating with the fishermen, we'll go to the tool shop here in town.

<p id="L174"><br></p>
<p id="L175"><br></p>
<p id="L176">And while I was concerned about my own possessions, I was also somewhat excited about the fact that I would be able to use the money I earned to provide for my future needs.<br><sup>そして、自分の所持金を気にしながらも、これからの必要なものを、自分で稼いだ金で揃えていくというのも、何だかワクワクした。</sup><br><sup>And it was kind of exciting to use the money I earned to prepare what I needed from now on, even though I was worried about my own money.</sup></p>
<p id="L177"><br></p>
<p id="L178">Before I ran away from home, I had a fixed allowance every month, so I never had to worry about money.

<p id="L180">After running away from home, I survived for a bit in the mountains, where I met Aka, who gave me a hot meal and a place to sleep for free.<br><sup>家出してからも山で少しだけサバイバルしたが、アカさんと出会い、温かい食事と寝床をタダで与えてもらった。</sup><br><sup>Even after running away from home, I survived a little in the mountains, but I met Aka and was given a warm meal and a bed for free.</sup></p>
<p id="L181"><br></p>
<p id="L182">From there, I camped out while traveling to the next town, but as for food, Shinobu, who had been secretly tracking me from the shadows, regularly gave me rice balls.<br><sup>そこから次の街への移動の間は野宿をしたが、食事に関しては陰からコッソリと俺を追跡していたシノブが、定期的にライスボールをくれた。</sup><br><sup>I slept outdoors during the trip from there to the next city, but Sinob, who was chasing me from behind, regularly gave me rice balls.</sup></p>
<p id="L183"><br></p>
<p id="L184">After that, we had a brawl in Kantidan and were kidnapped by the Yamidire. In Kakretele, we were served three meals every day in the church, breakfast, lunch and dinner, without having to do anything.<br><sup>そのあとはカンティーダンで乱闘し、そのままヤミディレに攫われて、カクレテールでは、毎日教会で朝昼晩と三食メシが何もしなくても出てきた。</sup><br><sup>After that, he fought a brawl in Kantidan, and was kidnapped by Yamidile, and came out of Kakretail every day without breakfast, lunch, and three meals at church.</sup></p>
