<p id="L1">It's so bright. It's already morning.<br><sup>　眩しいな。もう朝だね。</sup><br><sup>It's dazzling. It's already morning.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">Feeling a little chilly, I lifted myself up from the bed and looked next to me to see a small bird that I had taken care of last night, breathing in its sleep.<br><sup>　少しの肌寒さを感じながらベッドから体を起こして隣を見ると、寝息を立てているのは、昨晩可愛がってあげた一羽の小鳥。</sup><br><sup>Feeling a little chilly, I got out of bed and looked next to me, and found a little bird I loved last night breathing.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">Is he tired?　He is in a deep sleep. I'd like to continue loving her in the morning, but my position doesn't allow me to do so.<br><sup>　疲れているのかな？　深い眠りについている。このまま朝も可愛がってあげたいけど、僕の立場上はそうもいかない。</sup><br><sup>Are you tired? I'm in a deep sleep.I want to love you in the morning, but from my point of view, it's not like that.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">Today, I'm going to have another morning training session with those cute girls.<br><sup>　今日も可愛いあの子たちと朝の調練だ。</sup><br><sup>It's morning training with cute girls again today.</sup></p>
<p id="L5">A few days ago, the first battle for us was crippled by Daddy's spear.<br><sup>　数日前、僕たちにとっての初陣はダディの横槍で不完全燃焼になってしまった。</sup><br><sup>A few days ago, our first battlefield was completely burned by Daddy's thrust.</sup></p>
<p id="L6">In truth, I was going to fly over the ground proudly and beautifully, dainty as can be.<br><sup>　本当ならば堂々と、そして美しく可憐に地上を飛び回るつもりだった。</sup><br><sup>If it were true, I would fly proudly and beautifully on the ground.</sup></p>
<p id="L7">But I couldn't do that.<br><sup>　しかし、それができなかった。</sup><br><sup>But I couldn't do that.</sup></p>
<p id="L8">Yamidire, a great sinner, surrendered of his own free will.<br><sup>　大罪人であるヤミディレは自らの意思で降伏した。</sup><br><sup>The great sinner, Yamidile, surrendered of his own accord.</sup></p>
<p id="L9">We got on the ground with great enthusiasm, but there was not so much as a battle, just a little skirmish ...... and then ......<br><sup>　意気揚々と地上へ乗り込んだ僕たちは、戦闘というほどのことはなく、ちょっとした小競り合い……あとは……</sup><br><sup>We got on the ground in high spirits, and there was nothing like a battle, but a little skirmish... and the rest...</sup></p>
<p id="L10"><br></p>
<p id="L11">"Is the scar on your cheek gone?" ......<br><sup>「頬の傷は消えたか……」</sup><br><sup>"Did the wound on my cheek disappear?"</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">I just had a little run-in with that sharp-eyed little boy.<br><sup>　あの目つきの鋭い坊やと少しだけやり合っただけ。</sup><br><sup>I just had a little fight with that sharp-eyed boy.</sup></p>
<p id="L14">No, it wasn't so much that we went at it.<br><sup>　いや、やり合ったなんてほどではない。</sup><br><sup>No, it's not as bad as fighting.</sup></p>
<p id="L15">But yet, in that little offense, that little boy put a scar on my cheek.<br><sup>　だが、それでいて、あの僅かな攻防であの坊やは僕の頬に傷をつけた。</sup><br><sup>But still, that little attack and defense scarred my cheek.</sup></p>
<p id="L16">I was surprised that there was anyone on earth who could do such a thing against my sigil eye.<br><sup>　僕の紋章眼を相手にそんなことできる者が地上に居るとは驚きだった。</sup><br><sup>It was surprising that there was someone on earth who could do such a thing against my heraldry eyes.</sup></p>
<p id="L17">Most importantly, Yamidire surrendered quietly because she herself was already exhausted.<br><sup>　何よりも、ヤミディレが大人しく降伏したのも既に彼女自身も疲弊していたから。</sup><br><sup>Above all, the reason why Yamidile surrendered quietly was because she was already exhausted.</sup></p>
<p id="L18">It was that little boy who drove her to such a state.<br><sup>　彼女をそんな状態まで追い詰めたのは、あの坊や。</sup><br><sup>It was that boy who drove her to such a state.</sup></p>
<p id="L19">What if I'm fighting a guy who's perfect?<br><sup>　もし、万全な彼と戦っていたら？</sup><br><sup>What if I fought him who was perfect?</sup></p>
<p id="L20">I felt a little frightened, but at the same time my body was tingling hotly.<br><sup>　少し恐ろしいと思うと同時に、体が熱く疼く。</sup><br><sup>I think it's a little scary, but at the same time I feel hot and painful.</sup></p>
<p id="L21">I've never had anything like this in my life.<br><sup>　これまでの人生、こんなことは無かった。</sup><br><sup>This has never happened in my life.</sup></p>
<p id="L22">What's ...... this feeling? ......<br><sup>　なんだろう……この気持ちは……</sup><br><sup>I wonder what it is... this feeling...</sup></p>
<p id="L23"><br></p>
<p id="L24">"Mmm-hmm, well. "Well, let's let the cute little bird sleep at ...... yet. They were singing so much yesterday.<br><sup>「ふふふふ、さて。可愛い小鳥は……まだ寝かせてあげるか。昨日はとても鳴いていたからねぇ」</sup><br><sup>"Well, now.The cute little bird... shall I put you to sleep yet?I was crying a lot yesterday."</sup></p>
<p id="L25"><br></p>
<p id="L26">I dressed myself and quietly left the room so as not to wake the little bird.<br><sup>　身なりを整えて、小鳥を起こさぬようにそっと部屋を出た。</sup><br><sup>I dressed up and slipped out of the room so as not to wake up the birds.</sup></p>
<p id="L27">And there it is: ......<br><sup>　するとそこには……</sup><br><sup>Then there's...</sup></p>
<p id="L28"><br></p>
<p id="L29">"Good morning, Prince ......."<br><sup>「王子……おはようございます」</sup><br><sup>"Prince... Good morning."</sup></p>
<p id="L30"><br></p>
<p id="L31">My cute little birds were already waiting for me, looking miffed and a little grumpy.<br><sup>　ムッとした顔でちょっと不機嫌な僕の可愛い小鳥たちが既に僕を待っていた。</sup><br><sup>My cute little birds, who were a little moody with angry faces, were already waiting for me.</sup></p>
<p id="L32"><br></p>
<p id="L33">"Hey, hey, what's up?"<br><sup>「や、やあ、どうしたんだい？」</sup><br><sup>"Hey, hey, what'said he, "what's the matter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L34">"Apart from ......, Prince ...... is also really tired night after night."<br><sup>「……別に……王子も毎晩毎晩本当にお疲れ様です」</sup><br><sup>"...not really...the prince did a great job every night."</sup></p>
<p id="L35">"I'm not sure what to say. The pouty face is cute too. Are you jealous?"<br><sup>「あ……あはははは。むくれた顔もかわいいな。ヤキモチかい？」</sup><br><sup>"Ah... hahaha.Your swollen face is cute, too.Are you jealous?"</sup></p>
<p id="L36">"Haha, ouji ......"<br><sup>「はうっ、おうじ……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my prince..."</sup></p>
<p id="L37"><br></p>
<p id="L38">This is what everyone looks like the day after they've adored a little bird.<br><sup>　小鳥を可愛がった翌日は、皆こんな感じだね。</sup><br><sup>The day after I loved birds, everyone looked like this.</sup></p>
<p id="L39">But if I smile just a little, the girls immediately blush and become distraught.<br><sup>　でも、僕が少し微笑むだけで彼女たちはすぐに顔を赤くして取り乱す。</sup><br><sup>But just by smiling a little, they quickly blush and get upset.</sup></p>
<p id="L40">Oh man, you're really loving it. ......<br><sup>　やれやれ、本当に愛おしいね……</sup><br><sup>Oh, my God, you're so lovely...</sup></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42">"Well, here's the drill. A few days ago it ended poorly, but we don't know when the all-out war with the ground will start."<br><sup>「さて、調練だ。数日前は不完全燃焼で終わったが、地上との全面戦争がいつ始まるか分からないしね」</sup><br><sup>"Now, training.A few days ago, it ended with incomplete combustion, but I don't know when the all-out war on the ground will start."</sup></p>
<p id="L43"><br></p>
<p id="L44">But we can't stay in peace forever.<br><sup>　だが、いつまでも平和でいられるわけではない。</sup><br><sup>However, it is not always possible to remain peaceful forever.</sup></p>
<p id="L45">With the will of the newly enthroned King of the Sky World, we, the Sky Tribe, are going to capture the supremacy of the world.<br><sup>　新たに即位した天空世界の王の意思で、僕たち天空族は世界の覇権を獲りにいく。</sup><br><sup>At the will of the newly enthroned king of the heavenly world, we, the heavenly people, go to gain hegemony over the world.</sup></p>
<p id="L46">War. It is something unknown to our generation, something we have only heard about in stories.<br><sup>　戦争。それは僕たちの世代は話でしか聞いたことがない未知のもの。</sup><br><sup>War. That's an unknown thing that our generation has only heard of in stories.</sup></p>
<p id="L47">To be honest, we would have been happy if we could have spent our days in peace and played with the birds, but we also wanted a place where we could show off the power we had trained and improved.<br><sup>　正直、毎日を平和に過ごし、小鳥たちと戯れて生きていければそれはそれで幸せでもあったが、鍛えて高めた自分たちの力を披露できる場が欲しかったのも事実。</sup><br><sup>To be honest, if we could live in peace every day and play with birds, we would be happy, but we wanted a place to train ourselves and show our strength.</sup></p>
<p id="L48">I am half nervous and half looking forward to the war, and these days everyone, including me, is full of motivation.<br><sup>　戦争というものに対しては、半分緊張、半分楽しみという気持ちがあり、最近では僕も含めて皆のやる気も満ちている。</sup><br><sup>I'm half nervous and half excited about war, and these days, everyone, including myself, is full of enthusiasm.</sup></p>
<p id="L49">And it's all because of "that guy" ......<br><sup>　それも全ては、「あの男」の……</sup><br><sup>It's all about that guy...</sup></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51">"Prince, ...... 'that man' wants to talk to Yamidire before the kneading ......."<br><sup>「王子、調練の前にヤミディレと話をしたいと……『あの男』が……」</sup><br><sup>"Prince, I want to talk to Yamidile before I train... 'That Man'..."</sup></p>
<p id="L52">"...... what?"<br><sup>「……なに？」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L53">"His Majesty will allow it if the Prince accompanies him. ......<br><sup>「陛下は、王子が帯同するのであれば許可すると……」</sup><br><sup>"Your Majesty will allow the prince to accompany him..."</sup></p>
<p id="L54">"...... Oh, okay. Then go get him. I'll head for the cell myself."<br><sup>「……そうか、分かった。では、彼を呼んできてくれたまえ。僕も牢に向かうよ」</sup><br><sup>"... I see, I see.Well, get him over here.I'm going to jail, too."</sup></p>
<p id="L55"><br></p>
<p id="L56">I met "that guy" a few years ago.<br><sup>　数年前に出会った「あの男」。</sup><br><sup>The man I met a few years ago.</sup></p>
<p id="L57">He brought everything to our world.<br><sup>　彼は僕たちの世界にあらゆるものをもたらした。</sup><br><sup>He brought everything into our world.</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">"Prince. Please be careful. The Yamidire has bound your hands and feet and blocked your eyes, but you never know what he might do. Please be careful. ......"<br><sup>「王子。気を付けてくださいね。ヤミディレは両手足を縛り、両目も塞いでおりますが、何をするか分かりません。くれぐれも……」</sup><br><sup>"Prince, be careful.He tied his hands and feet and closed his eyes, but he didn't know what to do.Thank you very much.</sup></p>
<p id="L60">"I know what I'm doing.<br><sup>「分かっているさ」</sup><br><sup>"I know,"</sup></p>
<p id="L61">"And to that guy, too. I ...... that guy not so much ......."<br><sup>「それと、あの男にもです。私……あの人のことはあまり……」</sup><br><sup>"And to him, too.I... I don't think much about him..."</sup></p>
<p id="L62">"'Hmmm, it's certainly amusing, but not to be trusted. But don't worry about me, okay?　I won't do anything to make you sad."<br><sup>「ふふふ、確かに愉快ではあるが信用はできないからね。でも、僕に心配はいらないよ？　君たちを悲しませるようなことはしないさ」</sup><br><sup>"Hmm, it's fun, but I can't trust you.But don't worry about me.I won't do anything to make you sad."</sup></p>
<p id="L63">"Uh-uh."<br><sup>「はうぅ」</sup><br><sup>"Huh,"</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">A long time ago, the world in the sky suffered tremendous damage from Yamidire's betrayal, and stood idly by without interfering in the conflicts of the earthly world.<br><sup>　遥か昔、ヤミディレの裏切りから甚大な被害を受け、地上世界の争いに干渉せずに静観していた天空の世界。</sup><br><sup>A long time ago, the world of the sky was severely damaged by the betrayal of the yamidire and stood by without interfering with the conflict of the earth world.</sup></p>
<p id="L66">As God's apostles, we were not going to get involved in the silly conflicts of the unholy earth.<br><sup>　神の使徒である僕たちは、穢れた地上のくだらない争いには関わらないとしていた。</sup><br><sup>We, as apostles of God, were not to be involved in a silly fight on the dirty earth.</sup></p>
<p id="L67">However, he brushed us off, saying that we were scared and withdrawn.<br><sup>　しかし、そんな僕らを彼は「怯えて引きこもっていた」とアッサリと言い切った。</sup><br><sup>However, he declared us "stunned and secluded."</sup></p>
<p id="L68">And his words and presence eventually brought about a great change in this country, this world, and the Sky Tribe.<br><sup>　そして彼の言葉や存在は、やがてこの国、この世界、そして天空族に大きな変革をもたらした。</sup><br><sup>And his words and presence eventually revolutionized this country, this world, and the people of heaven.</sup></p>
<p id="L69">Now they even want to have an all-out confrontation with the ground: ......<br><sup>　今では地上との全面対決すらも望むような……</sup><br><sup>Now I even want a full-scale confrontation with the ground...</sup></p>
<p id="L70"><br></p>
<p id="L71">"I feel like I'm dancing in his hands. ...... In any case, once the execution of ...... Yamidire is over, it's all over. I'm sure you'll agree. And if I am successful, ...... Daddy will approve of me. ......"<br><sup>「ふふふ……何だか彼の掌で踊らされているような気もするが……いずれにせよ……ヤミディレの処刑が終われば全ての幕開けとなる。そして僕が戦果を上げれば……ダディも認めてくれるはずだ……」</sup><br><sup>"Hmm... I feel like I'm being made to dance in his palm... in any case... everything will begin when Yamidile's execution is over.And if I achieve the results of the war... Daddy should recognize me..."</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">And that's what I want.<br><sup>　そして、それこそが僕の望み。</sup><br><sup>And that's what I want.</sup></p>
<p id="L74">Even if thousands and thousands of little birds fall in love with you,...... I'm sorry, but those are all comforting,...... and the only person you want to admit it to is .......<br><sup>　数千数万の小鳥たちに惚れられても……失礼だけれどそれらでは全て慰めにしかならない……認めて欲しいのは……ただ一人。</sup><br><sup>Even if you fall in love with tens of thousands of small birds... I'm sorry, but they're all comforting... I want you to admit... there's only one person.</sup></p>
<p id="L75">My life has not changed since I was a child.<br><sup>　子供のころから変わらない僕の―――</sup><br><sup>It hasn't changed since I was a child.</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">"...... have you set a date for my execution?"<br><sup>「……私の処刑の日でも決まったか？」</sup><br><sup>"...did you decide on the day of my execution?"</sup></p>
<p id="L78">"What?<br><sup>「ッ！？」</sup><br><sup>"What!"</sup></p>
<p id="L79"><br></p>
<p id="L80">As I walked through the dark corridor leading to the prison, I heard a voice from the other side of the darkness.<br><sup>　牢へと続く暗闇の回廊を進む途中、闇の向こうから聞こえてきた声。</sup><br><sup>A voice came from beyond the darkness as I went down the dark corridor leading to the prison.</sup></p>
<p id="L81">The goose bumps all over my body revolted.<br><sup>　思わず全身の鳥肌が逆立った。</sup><br><sup>I got goosebumps all over my body.</sup></p>
<p id="L82"><br></p>
<p id="L83">"......"<br><sup>「ッ……」</sup><br><sup>"Huh..."</sup></p>
<p id="L84"><br></p>
<p id="L85">Sweat on your back?　Sweat on my hands?　Did I just pressurize you for a second?<br><sup>　背中に汗？　手にも？　今の一瞬だけで僕が気圧された？</sup><br><sup>Sweat on my back? On my hand?Did I get pressure in just this moment?</sup></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">"Is that ...... the prince or something?"<br><sup>「その気配は……例の王子とかいう者か？」</sup><br><sup>"Is that the sign... the prince?"</sup></p>
<p id="L88"><br></p>
<p id="L89">She is locked in a magic-proof prison with multiple techniques, her hands and feet are tightly bound, and even her eyes are covered with cloth so that she cannot see.<br><sup>　何重もの術式を施して魔法が使えない牢に閉じ込め、両手足も厳重に縛り、更にはその両目も布を当てて見えないようにしている。</sup><br><sup>He was locked up in a prison where magic could not be used, his hands and feet were tightly tied, and his eyes were covered with cloth so that he could not see.</sup></p>
<p id="L90">Even though I was literally helpless, just hearing his voice made me ......<br><sup>　文字通り手も足も出ない状況だというのに、声を聞いただけで僕は……</sup><br><sup>I literally couldn't get my hands on it, but just hearing my voice...</sup></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">"Mm-hmm, no. I just wanted to check on you. ...... And there's a guy who wants to meet you."<br><sup>「ふふふ、いや。ちょっと様子を見にね……それに、あなたに会いたいという男が居てね」</sup><br><sup>"Huh, no. I'm just going to see how it goes... and there's a man who wants to see you."</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94">I try to act like I'm not too upset, but I'm pathetic, too.<br><sup>　動揺を悟られないように余裕を装うが、情けないね、僕も。</sup><br><sup>I pretend not to be upset, but I'm pathetic, too.</sup></p>
<p id="L95">Yamidire has now recovered her magic and strength.<br><sup>　今では魔力も体力も回復しているヤミディレ。</sup><br><sup>Now, both magic and physical strength are restored.</sup></p>
<p id="L96">What if there's a mistake and she gets out of this cell?<br><sup>　もし、何かの間違いで彼女がこの牢から出たら？</sup><br><sup>What if she gets out of this dungeon for some mistake?</sup></p>
<p id="L97">I didn't understand it a few days ago, but now that I see her in her recovered state, I understand a lot more.<br><sup>　数日前では分からなかったが、こうして回復した状態の彼女を見れば、色々と分かってくる。</sup><br><sup>I didn't know a few days ago, but when I see her recovering like this, I understand a lot of things.</sup></p>
<p id="L98">Strong. ......<br><sup>　強いな……</sup><br><sup>You're strong...</sup></p>
<p id="L99"><br></p>
<p id="L100">"Hey, are you keeping your word?"<br><sup>「おい、約束は守っているか？」</sup><br><sup>"Do you keep your word?"</sup></p>
<p id="L101">"Promise?"<br><sup>「約束？」</sup><br><sup>"Promise?"</sup></p>
<p id="L102">"It's about Master Kron.<br><sup>「クロン様の件だ」</sup><br><sup>"It's about Mr. Cron,"</sup></p>
<p id="L103"><br></p>
<p id="L104">However, such a woman also has a weakness, or rather, a surprising one,......, that she would like to protect even at the cost of her own life.<br><sup>　しかし、そんな彼女にも弱点というか……意外にも、自分の命と引き換えにしてでも守りたいものがある。</sup><br><sup>But she has a weakness... Surprisingly, there is something she wants to protect in exchange for her life.</sup></p>
<p id="L105">Yes, we didn't put her in this prison by force.<br><sup>　そう、僕たちは実力で彼女をこの牢に入れたわけではない。</sup><br><sup>Well, we didn't put her in this dungeon by force.</sup></p>
<p id="L106">He had only dealt with her in her exhausted state.<br><sup>　疲弊しきった状態の彼女と取引をしたにすぎない。</sup><br><sup>I just made a deal with her, who was exhausted.</sup></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">"No problem. I haven't sent a single stamp to that island nation since."<br><sup>「問題ないよ。あの島国にはあれから一切手を出していない」</sup><br><sup>"No problem. I haven't sent a stamp to that island country since then."</sup></p>
<p id="L109">"Then fine. Why don't you just get on with executing him?"<br><sup>「なら、構わん。さっさと処刑したらどうだ？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I don't mind.Why don't you execute him quickly?"</sup></p>
<p id="L110">"Well, wait a minute. I'm a big guy like you. There's a lot of formalities involved."<br><sup>「まぁ、待ってくれ。あなたほどの大物だ。色々と手続きがあるんだよ」</sup><br><sup>"Well, wait a minute.He's as big as you.There are a lot of procedures."</sup></p>
<p id="L111">"Hmm, you're probably preparing a stunt so the Dictator can show off his power, aren't you?"<br><sup>「ふん、どうせ『ディクテイタ』が自分の力を誇示できるよう演出の準備でもしているのだろう？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, are you preparing for the production so that Dictator can show off his power anyway?"</sup></p>
<p id="L112"><br></p>
<p id="L113">That said, Yamidire snickers at Daddy. In case you were wondering, I heard that the two of you are the same age,......, but is there anything else?<br><sup>　そう言って、ヤミディレはダディを鼻で笑っている。一応二人は同世代とは聞いていたが……何か他にもあるのか？</sup><br><sup>Yamidile laughs at Daddy with his nose to nose-to- nose.I heard that they are of the same generation... is there anything else?</sup></p>
<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115">"Hey, tell your father.<br><sup>「おい、父親に伝えておけ」</sup><br><sup>"Hey, tell your father,"</sup></p>
<p id="L116">"What?<br><sup>「え？」</sup><br><sup>"What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L117">"You can wage war all you want, but ...... you're not going to get the earth or the demon world.<br><sup>「戦争をするのは勝手だが……貴様らごときでは地上も魔界も手に入れられないとな」</sup><br><sup>"It's up to me to wage a war... but like you, I can't get both the earth and the magical world."</sup></p>
<p id="L118">"What?<br><sup>「ッ！？」</sup><br><sup>"What!"</sup></p>
<p id="L119">"I'm not that naive. That's why I've been hiding for fifteen years until I'm ready."<br><sup>「そこまで甘くはない。だからこそ、私も準備が整うまで十五年も隠れていたのだからな」</sup><br><sup>"It's not that sweet.That's why I've been hiding for fifteen years before I'm ready."</sup></p>
<p id="L120"><br></p>
<p id="L121">Even with such a strong presence and power, I was surprised by the unexpected words that Yamidire spoke.<br><sup>　これほどの存在感と力を感じさせながらも、ヤミディレが口にした意外な言葉に驚いた。</sup><br><sup>I was surprised at the unexpected words that Yamidile said while making me feel this presence and power.</sup></p>
<p id="L122"><br></p>
<p id="L123">"Is it called the ...... brave men on earth and the remnants of the ...... demon king's army?"<br><sup>「それは……地上の勇者と呼ばれる者たちと……魔王軍残党というものかい？」</sup><br><sup>"Is that... with those who are called the brave on earth... remnants of the demon army?"</sup></p>
<p id="L124">"It's ...... abhorrent, but at least ...... 'Hero Heero' is stronger than me. "At least ...... the brave Hylo is stronger than me, and I'm sure the Lycantant won't be quiet about it. ......"<br><sup>「……忌々しいが……少なくとも……『勇者ヒイロ』は私よりも強い。『ライファント』も黙っていないだろうしな……」</sup><br><sup>"... abominable, but at least...

<p id="L125">"Huh.<br><sup>「へぇ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L126">"You execute me and talk about it as if you've resolved a stain on history and boosted the morale of the sky tribe ......, but that's where you peak.<br><sup>「私を処刑し、歴史の汚点でも解消したみたいに触れ回って天空族の士気を上げる……だが、そこが貴様らのピークだ」</sup><br><sup>"He executed me and touched me as if I had solved the stigma of history... but that's your peak."</sup></p>
<p id="L127">"............"<br><sup>「…………」</sup><br><sup>「…………」</sup></p>
