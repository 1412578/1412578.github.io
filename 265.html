<p id="L1">With the sensation of being sucked in and then slowly out again, the flash of light that had surrounded me cleared.<br><sup>吸い込まれ、しかし徐々に再び外へ出るような感覚と共に、俺を包んだ閃光が晴れた。</sup><br><sup>The flash that enveloped me cleared up with the feeling of being inhaled, but gradually going out again.</sup></p>

<p id="L3">"Oh, this is the ...... forest?"<br><sup>「ッ、ここは……森？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, this is... a forest?"</sup></p>
<p id="L4">"Well, it's the same forest ...... as before, but it's a little ......, no, a lot has changed.<br><sup>『うむ、先ほどと同じ森……だが、少し……いや、色々と変わっているな』</sup><br><sup>'Well, the same forest as before... but a little... no, there are a lot of changes.'</sup></p>
<p id="L5"><br></p>
<p id="L6">The area was already dimly lit. I thought it was the same forest I had seen before, but the trees looked different in some places, so even if it was the same place, I knew it wasn't the same time.<br><sup>辺りは既に薄暗かった。一度目にした森かと思ったが生えていると木とかが所々違って見えたので、仮に同じ場所だとしても同じ時代じゃないんだろうなというのは感じた。</sup><br><sup>It was already dark around."I thought it was a forest I saw for the first time, but when it was growing, the trees looked different here and there, so I felt that even if we were in the same place, we wouldn't be in the same era."</sup></p>
<p id="L7">But that's not what's bothering me. What's bothering me is this air.<br><sup>だが、そんなことより俺が気になるのは、この空気。</sup><br><sup>But what bothers me more than that is this atmosphere.</sup></p>
<p id="L8"><br></p>
<p id="L9">"You're at ....... ......<br><sup>「ッ……居るな……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh... there you are..."</sup></p>

<p id="L11">He bends down in a whisper.<br><sup>思わず小声で身を屈める。</sup><br><sup>crouch down in an involuntary whisper.</sup></p>
<p id="L12">Yes, it's not just the scenery that's different.<br><sup>そう、違うのは風景だけではない。</sup><br><sup>Yes, scenery is not the only difference.</sup></p>
<p id="L13">Clearly, the air emanating from this forest was different.<br><sup>明らかにこの森の中から発せられる空気が違う。</sup><br><sup>Obviously, the air coming out of this forest is different.</sup></p>
<p id="L14">There was a hint of murder in the air.<br><sup>漂うのは殺気。</sup><br><sup>It's murderous to drift.</sup></p>
<p id="L15">And even if you can't see it, you know it somehow.<br><sup>そして、目に見えなくても何となくだが分かる。</sup><br><sup>And somehow you can tell even if you can't see it.</sup></p>
<p id="L16">From this forest, I can feel multiple signs of life around me in the darkness of the night.<br><sup>この森からは、夜の闇に紛れ、複数の気配が辺りから感じる。</sup><br><sup>From this forest, you can feel several signs from around you in the darkness of the night.</sup></p>

<p id="L20">The corner of Traina's mouth hung up sharply.<br><sup>トレイナの口角が鋭く吊り上がっている。</sup><br><sup>The corners of the mouth of the trainer are sharply raised.</sup></p>
<p id="L21">It's as if he's shaking like a warrior. ......<br><sup>まるで、武者震いでもしているかのように……</sup><br><sup>It's as if you're shaking a warrior...</sup></p>
<p id="L22"><br></p>

<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25">What?<br><sup>ッ？！</sup><br><sup>Huh?!</sup></p>

<p id="L27">"No, they're not here. I thought I saw some kind of glow. ......"<br><sup>「いや、こっちにはいない。なんか光ったと思ったんだけどなぁ……」</sup><br><sup>"No, I'm not here.I thought it glittered..."</sup></p>

<p id="L30">You can hear the voice ......, and obviously the quality of the voice is not solid.<br><sup>声が聞こえ……明らかに声の質が堅気じゃない。</sup><br><sup>I can hear your voice... obviously the quality of your voice is not solid.</sup></p>

<p id="L33">"Any other intruders?<br><sup>「他の侵入者は？」</sup><br><sup>"Any other intruders?"</sup></p>

<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">I almost surprised myself out loud.<br><sup>思わず声に出して驚くところだった。</sup><br><sup>I was almost surprised to hear it out loud.</sup></p>
<p id="L41">It's because they are having a conversation about "taking care of it" too matter-of-factly.<br><sup>あまりにも平然と「始末した」という会話をしているからだ。</sup><br><sup>This is because they are talking too calmly about "cleaning up."</sup></p>
<p id="L42">I knew in my gut that it wasn't a metaphor, but a direct meaning of "killed.<br><sup>それが何かの例えではなく、直接的な「殺した」という意味だというのは俺にも直感で分かった。</sup><br><sup>I knew intuitively that it meant direct "kill" rather than a metaphor for something.</sup></p>
<p id="L43">The owner of the voice, and the guy who smelled so much blood and killing energy, would do it. It was enough to make me think that.<br><sup>この声の主、そしてこれだけの殺気や血の匂いを漂わせている奴ならヤル。そう思わせるに十分なほどだった。</sup><br><sup>The Lord of this voice, and the smell of blood and blood, were enough to make him think so.</sup></p>
<p id="L44"><br></p>
<p id="L45">"Child. Do not move your body. ...... Slowly move only your head and eyes. ...... Look at the owner of the voice. Don't make a sound. Don't make a sound, and don't make a sound. It's not a person. It's a demon soldier.<br><sup>『童。体を動かさず……ゆっくりと頭と眼だけを動かして……声の主を見ろ。音を立てるな。声も絶対出すな。人ではない。魔族の兵だ』</sup><br><sup>"Children, don't move your body... just move your head and eyes slowly... look at the Lord of your voice.Don't make any noise. Don't make any noise.It's not a person. It's a demon soldier.'</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">I was still lying on my face, but I moved my head a little bit, paying close attention to what Traina told me, and turned my eyes towards the direction of the voice.<br><sup>うつ伏せのままだった俺は、トレイナに言われた通り、細心の注意を払って少しだけ頭を動かして、声がした方へ眼を向ける。</sup><br><sup>As I was lying face down, I moved my head a little with great care and turned my eyes to the direction where my voice.</sup></p>
<p id="L48">And there it is: ......<br><sup>するとそこには……</sup><br><sup>Then there's...</sup></p>
<p id="L49"><br></p>
<p id="L50">"So all we have to do is catch the kid who got blown up by the General and ran away.<br><sup>「ってことは、あとは『将軍』にふっとばされて逃げたあのガキを捕まえるだけか」</sup><br><sup>"So all I have to do is catch the boy who ran away after being kicked off by the General."</sup></p>
<p id="L51">"You will."<br><sup>「そうなるな」</sup><br><sup>"Don't be like that,"</sup></p>
<p id="L52">"But aren't they already on the run?"<br><sup>「でも、もう逃げてるんじゃねえのか？」</sup><br><sup>"But aren't you already running away?"</sup></p>
<p id="L53">"Idiot. What did the General say?　He's not dead because of the way he felt when I blew him up. But the wound wasn't so light that he could escape."<br><sup>「バカ。将軍も言ってたろ？　吹っ飛ばした時の手ごたえで、奴は死んでねぇって。でも、逃げられるほど傷も浅くないってよ」</sup><br><sup>"You idiot, the general told you, didn't he?He's not dead by the way he blew it off.But the wound is not shallow enough to escape."</sup></p>
<p id="L54">"Yeah, but you know what?<br><sup>「そーだけどよ」</sup><br><sup>"That'said he.</sup></p>
<p id="L55">"Don't be silly. If you capture him with this, we'll get our reward, okay?"<br><sup>「ぼやくな。これで奴を捕獲すりゃ、俺たちには褒美が出るぞ？」</sup><br><sup>"Don't murmur. If we catch him with this, we'll get a reward."</sup></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">He wears heavy armor, has a huge axe, and is ...... bipedal, but he is not human. ...... A giant ......<br><sup>重厚な鎧を纏い、巨大なアックスを持ち……二足歩行ではあるものの、人間ではなく……巨漢の……</sup><br><sup>Wearing heavy armor and carrying a huge axe... although bipedal, not human... giant...</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">"...... rhino?<br><sup>『……サイ？』</sup><br><sup>'... rhinoceros?'</sup></p>
<p id="L60">"Hmmm ...... rhinoceros people ......<br><sup>『ふふふ……犀人族……』</sup><br><sup>"Huh... the rhinoceros..."</sup></p>
<p id="L61"><br></p>
<p id="L62">Definitely a demon ...... and ......<br><sup>間違いなく魔族の……しかも……</sup><br><sup>It's definitely a demon... and...</sup></p>
<p id="L63"><br></p>
<p id="L64">"There's no doubt about this armor. It's a soldier of the Demon Lord's army.<br><sup>『この鎧は間違いない。魔王軍の兵だな』</sup><br><sup>"This armour is sure to be sure of it.You're a soldier of the Devil's Army.'</sup></p>
<p id="L65">"What?<br><sup>『ッ！？』</sup><br><sup>'What!'</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">Why are there soldiers from the Demon Lord's army here?　No, I don't need to think about that.<br><sup>なぜここに魔王軍の兵が居る？　いや、そんなこと考えるまでも無い。</sup><br><sup>Why are there demon soldiers here?No, you don't have to think about it.</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">"It seems that part of the ...... empire's territory is at war with the Demon Lord's army. ......<br><sup>『どうやら……帝国の領土の一部で、魔王軍と戦争中のようだな……』</sup><br><sup>'It seems... it's part of the empire and it's at war with the demon army...'</sup></p>
<p id="L70">"Oh, no. ......<br><sup>『そ、そんな……』</sup><br><sup>'Well, that's...</sup></p>

<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">War. It's a word I've heard many times before, only in textbooks or in the old stories of my father and other adults.<br><sup>戦争。これまで何度も、教科書とか、親父や大人たちの昔話の中でしか聞いたことのない単語だ。</sup><br><sup>War. It's a word that I've only heard in textbooks and old stories of my father and adults many times.</sup></p>
<p id="L74">I always found it annoying that it was "before I was born.<br><sup>俺はいつもそれを「俺が生まれる前の話」とうっとおしがった。</sup><br><sup>I always thought it was a story before I was born.</sup></p>
<p id="L75">But that thing called war is ......<br><sup>でも、その戦争というものが……</sup><br><sup>But the war...</sup></p>

<p id="L77">"Wait, wait, wait!　There's a war here!　What about the village?　My grandmother, my father, my mother!<br><sup>『って、待てよ！　ここで戦争！？　じゃあ、村は？　おばあちゃまや親父や母さんが！』</sup><br><sup>'Wait a minute! War here!?Then what about the village?Grandma, father and mother!'</sup></p>
<p id="L78"><br></p>
<p id="L79">I don't know if this is years before or years after where I was just now.<br><sup>ここが、俺がさっき居た場所の何年前なのか、それとも数年後の世界なのかは分からない。</sup><br><sup>I don't know how many years ago this was where I was, or if this is the world in a few years.</sup></p>

<p id="L88"><br></p>
<p id="L89">"Let's just get the ...... intruders out of the way for now, ...... huh?"<br><sup>「とりあえず、さっさと片付けちまおうぜ……侵入者を……なぁ？」</sup><br><sup>"First of all, let's get rid of the intruders... you know?"</sup></p>
<p id="L90">"Oh ...... yeah ...... hey?"<br><sup>「ああ……そうだ……なぁ？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh... that's right... you know?"</sup></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">Hmm?　What is it?　Suddenly, the rough tone of the Sai people's voices became a little quieter. ......!　Our eyes met...!<br><sup>ん？　なんだ？　急に荒っぽかったサイ人たちの声のトーンがちょっと静かに……ッ！？　目が合っ―――！？</sup><br><sup>Huh? What? The tone of the suddenly rough rhinoceros' voices is a little quiet...?My eyes meet????</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94">"Run, child, run!　They know you're here!<br><sup>『童、逃げろ！　バレているぞ！』</sup><br><sup>"Children, run away! You're caught!"</sup></p>
<p id="L95">"What?"<br><sup>「ちっ！？」</sup><br><sup>"What!"</sup></p>

<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115">"I'm afraid of the lowlife's idea of assassinating the general just to get credit for it. ...... And no matter how strong they are, the idea of pitting a kid like that against the general and having them go toe-to-toe is scary.<br><sup>「手柄欲しさに将軍暗殺なんてしようとしやがって……しかも、いくら強いとはいえ、あんなガキと将軍をぶつけて、最悪相打ちにさせようとか、下衆な奴らの発想は怖いぜ」</sup><br><sup>"They're trying to assassinate the general to get credit... and no matter how strong they are, I'm afraid they'll bump such a boy into the general and make him the worst of it."</sup></p>

<p id="L121"><br></p>
<p id="L122">But these guys think I'm a Confederate, don't they?　And the Kingdom of Betrayal?<br><sup>にしても、こいつらは俺を連合軍と勘違いしている？　しかもベトレイアル王国？</sup><br><sup>But do they think I'm a coalition?And the Kingdom of Vetrair?</sup></p>
<p id="L123"><br></p>
<p id="L124">It was probably an attempt to assassinate the general of the troops camped here in a night raid.

<p id="L126">And it seems that there are still other survivors, and they think I'm one of them. ...... Oh, that's so annoying .......<br><sup>そして、他にもまだ生き残りがいるみたいで、俺もその一人と勘違いされて……あ～、めんどくさ……。</sup><br><sup>And it seems that there are still other survivors, and I was mistaken for one of them...

<p id="L127">So, what do we do now?<br><sup>さて、どうする？</sup><br><sup>Now, what are we going to do?</sup></p>
<p id="L128">These guys will be strong in their own right.<br><sup>こいつらはそれなりに強いだろう。</sup><br><sup>These guys must be pretty strong.</sup></p>
<p id="L129">In addition, my body might be a little stiff from the war mode air I'm experiencing for the first time.<br><sup>ましてや、この初めて体感する戦争モードの空気に俺の身体も少し硬くなってるかもしれねえ。</sup><br><sup>What's more, my body may be a little stiffened by the air in war mode that I've never experienced before.</sup></p>

<p id="L134">"Okay.<br><sup>『分かった』</sup><br><sup>"All right,"</sup></p>
