<p id="L50">"But no. The women of the Sky Tribe had wings and a little better skin on their bones than other people, but there was nothing special about them when I fucked them. No matter how beautiful they were, they got bored after three times. And they're all so dull and unattainable that you can't help but fall for them as soon as you hit on them with a sweet face, and they're so flowery-headed and full of assumptions that they're almost annoying these days.<br><sup>「でも、ダメだねえ。天空族の女も、羽が生えて、骨の上のツラの皮が少し人より優れてるだけで、ヤッても特別なことは特になかったねえ。どんな美人も三回ヤレば飽きた。それにどいつもこいつも、甘い顔して口説いたらすぐに落ちるほどチョロくて達成感ないし、頭がお花畑だったり思い込みが激しかったりで、最近ではうっとおしいぐらい」</sup><br><sup>"But it's no good.The women of the heavenly tribe, too, had feathers and a little better skin than men, and nothing special.Every beautiful woman gets tired of three times.Besides, both Germany and this guy are so slow and unfulfilled that they fall off as soon as they try to persuade them with a sweet face, and their heads are in the flower garden and their assumptions are so intense that they are annoying these days."</sup></p>

<p id="L57">"But I spent my days here eating and sleeping, drinking and sleeping, making noise and sleeping, screwing and sleeping. After hundreds of years of war, this world of clouds drifting in the sky was just the thing to give me peace of mind, and I found myself living in comfort for several years.<br><sup>「まっ、でも食っちゃ寝、飲んじゃ寝、騒いじゃ寝、ヤッて寝、そんな毎日の繰り返しをここで過ごしていたよ。何百年も戦争ばかりだったオレには、空を漂うだけのこの雲の世界は心の平穏そのもので、何だかんだで気づけば数年間は悠々自適に過ごしてたよ」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, but I've been eating and drinking and sleeping, drinking and sleeping, making a fuss and sleeping here every day.For me, who had been at war for hundreds of years, this world of clouds floating in the sky was calm itself, and for some reason I found myself spending a few years in peace."</sup></p>

<p id="L69">"I've been enjoying my time in ...... peace and quiet,...... but I'm getting tired of the unchanging weather. In the event that you are not in a position to take advantage of this, it is possible that you will be able to take advantage of it.<br><sup>「ん～……まっ、平穏にノンビリ過ごしていたのだけど……でもね、変わらない天気もいい加減飽きるもの。漂うだけの雲も、時には雷を落としたり、雨雲になったりして、荒れた天気になってくれないと、刺激を感じず腐っちゃうわけだしねぇ」</sup><br><sup>"Well... well, I was spending my time peacefully... but I get tired of the constant weather.Clouds that float, sometimes thunder, sometimes rain, and if they don't become rough weather, they'll rot without feeling stimulated."</sup></p>

<p id="L71">"...... help the ...... dictator for that?"<br><sup>「……そのために……ディクテイタに協力を？」</sup><br><sup>"...that's why... help the dictator?"</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">"You're not listening. Please tell me I've led you on. But it's been a while since I've had a good laugh at the ugly power struggles between angels, who are no different from the rest of the earth or the demon world, just by playing politics and human relations in their ears.<br><sup>「人聞きが悪い。誘導したと言ってくれ。でも、ちょっと政治や人の関係弄って耳打ちするだけで、天使共も地上や魔界と変わらない、醜い勢力争いとか繰り広げちゃって、久々ウケたよ」</sup><br><sup>"It's hard to hear.Tell me you guided me.But it was funny for the first time in a long time that angels fought for ugly power just by playing with politics and human relationships and whispering."</sup></p>
<p id="L74"><br></p>
<p id="L75"><br></p>
<p id="L76">So that's what it is. ...... How come the sky tribe, which has been non-interference in the world for so long, has come to capture the world now? ...... Mostly, how could a scum like Dictator become the sky king? I'm not sure what to make of this. ...... Was this man's scheme working behind the scenes?<br><sup>そういうことか……どうしてずっと世界に不干渉だった天空族が今さら世界を獲りに来たのか……大体どうしてディクテイタのようなカスが天空王になれたのか……この男の策謀が裏で動いていたのか。</sup><br><sup>I see... I wonder why the heavenly people, who had always stayed out of the world, came to take the world now... I wonder how Dictita-like cus could become king of the sky... I wonder if this man's plot was working behind the scenes.</sup></p>
<p id="L77"><br></p>
<p id="L78">"I guess I was also a little inadequate in my own way.<br><sup>「ま、あとはオレもオレなりに不完全燃焼だったところもあったのかもねえ」</sup><br><sup>"Well, maybe there were places where I was incompletely burned."</sup></p>
<p id="L79">"What?<br><sup>「なに？」</sup><br><sup>"What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L80">"The best in the history of the demon world is the Great Demon Lord. The most fearsome in the history of the demon world is Hakuki's husband. So, what about me?　Maybe the worst demon race in the history of the demon world?　If so, you have to destroy it moderately.<br><sup>「魔界史上最高は大魔王様。魔界史上最恐はハクキの旦那。で、オレは？　たぶん、魔界史上最悪の魔族かな？　なら、適度に荒らさないと」</sup><br><sup>"The greatest demon in the history of the demon world.The scariest thing in the history of magic is Hakuki's husband.So what about me?Maybe the worst demons in the history of magic?Then I have to ravage them moderately."</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">And I used to wonder about the dumb things I did.<br><sup>そして、私としたことがマヌケなことを疑問に思ったものだ。</sup><br><sup>And I used to wonder that what I did was stupid.</sup></p>
<p id="L83">What's this guy up to?　What does he want?<br><sup>この男が何を企んでいる？　何が目的？</sup><br><sup>What's this guy up to? What's his purpose?</sup></p>
<p id="L84">You can't help but wonder about such things.<br><sup>そんなことを疑問に思っても仕方ない。</sup><br><sup>It's no use questioning such a thing.</sup></p>
<p id="L85"><br></p>
<p id="L86">"Fifteen years have passed since the end of the war. The countries on earth have developed, the demon world has settled down, and the next generation has begun to grow up in both worlds. Considering the short lifespan of humans, Hiiro, Ma'am, and the other seven heroes are at their peak right now. If you want to create something that surpasses the past war parleys between humans and demons, now is the time!<br><sup>「戦後から十五年。地上の各国も発展して、魔界も落ち着き、両世界とも次世代たちが育ち始めた。寿命の短い人間たちを考えると、ヒイロもマアムも、他の七勇者共も今がまさにピーク。過去の人魔の戦争パーリーを超えるものを生み出すには、今でしょ！」</sup><br><sup>"Fifteen years since the end of World War II.Countries on the ground have developed, demons have calmed down, and the next generation has begun to grow in both worlds.Considering the short-lived people, Hiro, Maam, and the other seven brave men are at their peak now.Now is the time to create more than the war parry of the past!"</sup></p>
