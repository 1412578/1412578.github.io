<p id="L1">She quieted the crying Amae.<br><sup>泣きじゃくるアマエを宥めていた。</sup><br><sup>He soothed the crying Amae.</sup></p>
<p id="L2"><br></p>
<p id="L3">"Hey, don't cry. It's not that I'm leaving you forever. Just for a while. ......"<br><sup>「なぁ、泣くなよ。あ～、別にずっとお別れってわけじゃないんだ。ただ、しばらく……」</sup><br><sup>"Don't cry, my dear.Oh, I'm not saying goodbye all the time.Just for a while..."</sup></p>
<p id="L4">"Ugh, geez, when is it gonna be a while?　Is it tomorrow?　...... the day after tomorrow?　...... more?"<br><sup>「うぅ、ぐすっ、しばらくっていつなの？　明日なの？　……あさってなの？　……もっとなの？」</sup><br><sup>"Ugh, when is it for a while?Tomorrow? ... the day after tomorrow? ... more?"</sup></p>
<p id="L5">"....... Yes, that's ......."<br><sup>「……そ、それは……」</sup><br><sup>"... well, that's..."</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">I'm at a loss for words, I'm so pathetic.<br><sup>言葉に詰まるとは、俺も情けねえな。</sup><br><sup>It's pathetic of me to be at a loss for words.</sup></p>
<p id="L8">I can't explain too difficult a situation to Amae. But that didn't mean I couldn't make promises about how long it would take.<br><sup>アマエにあまり難しい事情は説明できない。だからと言って軽はずみにいつまでとか約束が出来ない。</sup><br><sup>I can't explain to Amae how difficult it is.But I can't make an appointment without hesitation.</sup></p>
<p id="L9">And I can't even say that I'll see him again soon.<br><sup>ましてや「すぐまた会える」とも言い切れない。</sup><br><sup>Furthermore, it's hard to say that we'll see each other again.</sup></p>
<p id="L10">Whenever my mom and dad broke a promise they made to me, they'd say something like "next time," but the next time was ......<br><sup>親父と母さんは俺と約束したことを破っても「次は必ず」とかって言ってたけど、その次なんて……</sup><br><sup>My father and mother said, "Next time, definitely," even if they broke their promise to me, but I can't believe it'</sup></p>
<p id="L11"><br></p>
<p id="L12">"...... Amae...... stop crying."<br><sup>「……アマエ……泣くのはやめろ」</sup><br><sup>"...amae... stop crying."</sup></p>
<p id="L13">"High Priestess ......"<br><sup>「大神官さま……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my God..."</sup></p>
<p id="L14">"You'll always be a child.<br><sup>「いつまでも子供のままでいるな」</sup><br><sup>"Don't stay a child forever."</sup></p>
<p id="L15">"Uh-oh."<br><sup>「う～」</sup><br><sup>"Uh-huh."</sup></p>
<p id="L16"><br></p>
<p id="L17">Wait, Yami Dire?　What the hell are you doing being so hard on my sister?<br><sup>ちょ、ヤミディレ？　テメエ、俺の妹に何をキツイこと言ってんだよ！</sup><br><sup>Hey, Yamidire? Temae, what are you saying to my sister?</sup></p>
<p id="L18">Amae is still such a child. ......<br><sup>アマエはまだこんな子供なんだから……</sup><br><sup>Amae is still this kind of child...</sup></p>
<p id="L19"><br></p>
<p id="L20"><br></p>
<p id="L21">"Don't ever think that you can spoil yourself because you feel sorry for yourself because you don't have blood parents."<br><sup>「血の繋がった両親が居ない自分はかわいそうだから甘えてもいいなどと、いつまでも思うな？」</sup><br><sup>"Don't you always think that you can be spoiled because you feel sorry for yourself without your parents?"</sup></p>
<p id="L22"><br></p>
<p id="L23">"......dai shin kan ...... sama?"<br><sup>「……だいしんかん……さま？」</sup><br><sup>"...the Great Shogun...?"</sup></p>
<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25">"It's not that you're special in any way. Tsukushi, Karui, and the other daughters are all in the same ...... situation as you, and their lives are even more miserable than yours. There are plenty of them to sweep you off your feet."<br><sup>「何もお前が特別なわけではない。ツクシもカルイも他の娘たちも……いや、この世の至る所で……お前と同じ境遇で……それ以上に悲惨な人生を歩んでいる者は掃いて捨てるほどいる」</sup><br><sup>"Nothing special about you.Tsukushi, Karui, and the other daughters... no, all over the world... in the same situation as you... there are so many who live a more miserable life that they sweep away."</sup></p>
<p id="L26"><br></p>
<p id="L27"><br></p>
<p id="L28">Yamidire, holding the reins and looking straight ahead, dares to speak harshly to Amae, who is clinging to my chest.<br><sup>手綱を握って前を真っすぐ見ながら、俺の胸にしがみ付いているアマエに対して、あえて厳しい言葉をぶつけるヤミディレ。</sup><br><sup>He held the reins and looked straight ahead, and dared to hit harsh words at Amae, who was clinging to my chest.</sup></p>
<p id="L29">The words gouge Amae even more.<br><sup>その言葉が余計にアマエを抉る。</sup><br><sup>That word makes you feel even more flaxseed.</sup></p>
<p id="L30"><br></p>
<p id="L31"><br></p>
<p id="L32">"The fact that you've been able to be as selfish and spoiled as you want doesn't mean that you're special. It's just that Ma-chou, Tsukushi, and Karui, who had just lost their parents and hadn't yet learned to take care of you, happened to be repulsively good-natured.<br><sup>「お前が今まで好きにワガママ言って甘えられていたのは、お前が特別だったわけではない。両親を失ったばかりで物心ついていないお前を保護したマチョウが、ツクシが、カルイが、たまたま反吐が出るほどお人好しだっただけだ」</sup><br><sup>"It's not that you were special that you've been spoiled by all the whining you've been spoiled.It was just that Matthew, who had just lost his parents and had protected you, was so kind that Tsukushi happened to vomit."</sup></p>
<p id="L33"><br></p>
<p id="L34">"Oh. ....... ......."<br><sup>「あぅ……う……」</sup><br><sup>"Ah... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh...</sup></p>
<p id="L35"><br></p>
<p id="L36">"This world is not so kind that you are the only one who can be indulged or selfish.<br><sup>「この世はお前だけが特別甘えたりワガママが許されるほど優しい世界なわけではないのだ」</sup><br><sup>"You are not the only one in this world who is so kind as to be spoiled or allowed to be spoiled."</sup></p>
<p id="L37"><br></p>
<p id="L38"><br></p>
<p id="L39">I don't know how much of Yamidire's words this small, young Amae understands.<br><sup>ヤミディレの言葉を、こんな小さく幼いアマエがどこまで理解できているか分からない。</sup><br><sup>I don't know how far such a small Amae can understand Yamidile's words.</sup></p>
<p id="L40">But at least they would know that Yamidire was speaking harshly.<br><sup>でも、少なくともヤミディレが厳しい言葉を言っていることは伝わっているはずだ。</sup><br><sup>But at least it should have been conveyed that Yamidile was speaking harshly.</sup></p>
<p id="L41">Because Amae is trembling so much.<br><sup>だって、アマエがこんなに震えている。</sup><br><sup>Because Amae is shaking like this.</sup></p>
<p id="L42">This dark woman ...... I'll kick you in the back and drop you?<br><sup>この暗黒女……後ろから蹴とばして落としてやろうか？</sup><br><sup>You dark woman... Do you want me to kick you off from behind?</sup></p>
<p id="L43"><br></p>
<p id="L44">"Children ......<br><sup>『童……』</sup><br><sup>"Children..."</sup></p>
<p id="L45">"I'm on .......<br><sup>『ッ……わーってるよ……』</sup><br><sup>'Oh... wow... wow...'</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">Trena murmurs a warning to me, but I know what I'm doing.<br><sup>トレイナが俺を諫めるように呟くが、俺も分かっている。</sup><br><sup>Trina muttered as if to admonish me, but I know.</sup></p>
<p id="L48">To be honest, the only way I can persuade Amae is to comfort her so as not to make her cry, and to deceive her with promises I can't guarantee.<br><sup>正直俺は、アマエをなるべく泣かせないよう慰めながら、保証できない約束で誤魔化すぐらいしか、アマエを説得することができない。</sup><br><sup>Honestly, I won't make Amae cry as much as possible.The only way to persuade Amae is to comfort her and deceive her with promises she cannot guarantee.</sup></p>
<p id="L49">Of course, it was the same for Kron, who loved Amae as much as I did.<br><sup>それは当然、アマエを俺と同じように可愛がっている、クロンも同じことだ。</sup><br><sup>Of course, Cron loves Amae as much as I do.</sup></p>
<p id="L50">If I really want to convince this Amae, I still have to tell her the reality.<br><sup>このアマエを本当に説得するのであれば、やはりどうしても現実を教えてやらなくちゃいけない。</sup><br><sup>If you really want to persuade Amae, you have to tell her the reality.</sup></p>
<p id="L51">Even if it results in more tears from Amae.<br><sup>その結果、アマエがもっと泣くことになろうともだ。</sup><br><sup>As a result, Amae will cry more.</sup></p>
<p id="L52">And Yamidire has taken it upon himself to do just that.<br><sup>そして、ヤミディレがその役目を自ら買って出たんだ。</sup><br><sup>And then the yamidire volunteered to play the role himself.</sup></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54">"So, the ...... High Priestess, the Goddess, and ...... Onii-chan went ...... somewhere and never came back?"<br><sup>「じゃあ……大神官さまも、女神さまも……おにーちゃんも……どっかいって、かえってこないの？」</sup><br><sup>"Then... the Great Priest, the Goddess, the Big Brother, aren't you coming back?"</sup></p>
<p id="L55">"I'm going somewhere. I'm not saying I won't come back, but I can't ...... say I'll be back easily or soon."<br><sup>「どこかへは行く。帰って来ないとは言わないが……簡単にすぐに帰ってくるとは言えない」</sup><br><sup>"I'm going somewhere.I won't say I won't come back, but... I can't say I'll be back soon easily."</sup></p>
<p id="L56">"Oh, no!　No! No!　No! No!　I'm not leaving you!"<br><sup>「うぅ、やーだー！　やだ！　いやなのー！　アマエ置いていくのやだー！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, no! I don't want to! I don't want to! I don't want to leave you behind!"</sup></p>
<p id="L57">"I can't do that. I'm not taking you."<br><sup>「それは無理だ。お前は連れて行かない」</sup><br><sup>"That's impossible.I won't take you with me."</sup></p>
<p id="L58">"Why!　No!　We all need to be together!　Why are you leaving Amae behind?<br><sup>「なんで！　やー！　みんないっしょじゃないといやああ！　なんでアマエおいてっちゃうの！」</sup><br><sup>"Why! Hey! We have to all be together!"Why are you leaving Amae behind?"</sup></p>
<p id="L59"><br></p>
<p id="L60">Finally, Amae let go of my clinging body, flipped herself around and reached behind her back for Yamidire, who was controlling the horse, and rocked her back and forth.<br><sup>ついにアマエはしがみ付いていた俺から体を離し、体を反転させて馬を操っているヤミディレに背中から手を伸ばして前後に揺すった。</sup><br><sup>At last Amae let go of me, who was clinging to her, and reached out from her back and shook her back and forth to Yamidile, who was turning her body upside down and controlling the horse.</sup></p>
<p id="L61"><br></p>
<p id="L62">"You don't like ...... Amae anymore?　Is Amae a ...... unwanted child?"<br><sup>「アマエのこと……きらいになっちゃったの？！　アマエは……いらない子なの？」</sup><br><sup>"You don't like Amae anymore?! Amae... you don't need her?"</sup></p>
<p id="L63"><br></p>
<p id="L64">Maybe Amae is the only girl in the world who can do this to Yami Dire. ......<br><sup>多分こんなことヤミディレにできる子なんて世界でアマエだけだろうな……</sup><br><sup>Maybe Amae is the only girl in the world who can do this to Yamidire...</sup></p>
<p id="L65"><br></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">"Why would I leave you?　It is because you are a small child, weak."<br><sup>「なぜ、お前を置いていくのか？　それはお前が小さな子供で弱いからだ」</sup><br><sup>"Why do I leave you behind?"That's because you're a little kid and you're weak."</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">"Because ...... is ...... for children?"<br><sup>「……こども……だから？」</sup><br><sup>"...child...that's why?"</sup></p>
<p id="L70"><br></p>
<p id="L71">"Yes. For some reason, Master Kron and I can no longer live with the others, and we must go away. From now on, Master Kron and I will have to do our best to protect ...... ourselves. We can't even protect you."<br><sup>「そうだ。事情があって私とクロン様はもう皆と一緒に住めなくなり、遠くへ行かなくてはならない。これからは、私もクロン様も……自分たちを守るだけで精一杯だ。お前のことまで守り切れん」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, for some reason, Mr. Cron and I can't live together anymore, and we have to go far away.From now on, both me and Mr. Cron... all we have to do is protect ourselves.I can't even protect you."</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73"><br></p>
<p id="L74">The words were too obvious, but in the end they were the only answer.<br><sup>その言葉は、あまりにも当たり前な言葉過ぎて、だけど答えは結局それしかないんだ。</sup><br><sup>That's too obvious a word, but that's the only answer.</sup></p>
<p id="L75">It's not that I don't like it. It's not that I don't like it.<br><sup>嫌いなわけではない。嫌いなはずがない。</sup><br><sup>It's not that I don't like it.You can't hate it.</sup></p>
<p id="L76">But why are you leaving them?　Because I can't protect them.<br><sup>だけど、何で皆と別れる？　それは守り切れないから。</sup><br><sup>But why do you break up with everyone?I can't keep it.</sup></p>
<p id="L77">Why are you leaving Amae?　Because she is a small, weak child with no strength.<br><sup>何でアマエを置いていく？　力のない小さく弱い子供だからだ。</sup><br><sup>Why do you leave Amae?Because she's a weak little child.</sup></p>
<p id="L78">Yes, because they're kids. ......<br><sup>そう、子供だから……</sup><br><sup>Yes, because I'm a child...</sup></p>
<p id="L79"><br></p>
<p id="L80">"Me too. ......<br><sup>『俺も……』</sup><br><sup>'Me too...'</sup></p>
<p id="L81">"Child?<br><sup>『童？』</sup><br><sup>"Children?"</sup></p>
<p id="L82">"So clearly ...... if it's true .......<br><sup>『そうハッキリと……本当なら……』</sup><br><sup>'That's clear... if it's true...'</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">To avoid making a small, weak child cry. Do not use harsh words as much as possible.<br><sup>小さく弱い子供を泣かせないために。厳しい言葉は極力言わない。</sup><br><sup>To keep young and weak children from crying.I won't say harsh words as much as I can.</sup></p>
<p id="L85">I tried to persuade Amae, but in the end all I could say was "I'll make it up to you next time", "Next time...", "I'm really sorry", just like my mom and dad had done to me.<br><sup>俺がアマエを説得しようとしても、結局は親父や母さんが俺にしたみたいに「今度埋め合わせをする」、「次こそは―――」、「ほんとごめんな」とかそういう言葉しか言えなかった。</sup><br><sup>When I tried to persuade Amae, all I could say was, "I'll make it up to you next time," "Next time --" and "I'm really sorry."</sup></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">"That's right. If you just love it and spoil it, it's no different from a pet animal.<br><sup>『そうだな。ただ可愛がって甘やかすだけなら、愛玩動物と変わらん』</sup><br><sup>"Well, if you just love and spoil him, he's no different from a pet."</sup></p>
<p id="L88">"Traina?<br><sup>『トレイナ？』</sup><br><sup>"Trainer?"</sup></p>
<p id="L89">I'm not sure if I'd be able to do that if I hadn't thought it through. That's why both Hiiro and Ma'am are immature as parents. It's a good thing that you're not the only one who has a problem with this.<br><sup>『時には怒り、状況によっては叩くことになろうとも、真剣に考えた上での言葉でなければな。だからヒイロもマアムも親としては未熟なのだ。まぁ、あいつら自身、自分たちが忙しくてまともな親でいることができないという負い目を自覚しているから……家出して好き放題する貴様を叱るよりも、謝ることを先に持っていこうとするのだ』</sup><br><sup>"Sometimes I get angry, sometimes I hit him, but it has to be a serious word.That's why Hiro and Maam are both immature parents.Well, they themselves are aware of the burden of being too busy to be proper parents... trying to bring an apology first rather than scolding you for running away from home and doing whatever you want."</sup></p>
<p id="L90"><br></p>
<p id="L91">I guess I'm a boomerang after all.<br><sup>結局は俺もブーメランなんだろう。</sup><br><sup>I guess I'm a boomerang after all.</sup></p>
<p id="L92"><br></p>
<p id="L93">"Is it difficult for you to understand what the ...... High Priestess of Amae ...... Yamidire is saying?"<br><sup>「アマエ……ヤミディレの……大神官の言ってることは難しいか？」</sup><br><sup>"Amae... of Yamidile... is it difficult for the Great Priest to say?"</sup></p>
<p id="L94">"...... Nanny?"<br><sup>「……おにーちゃん？」</sup><br><sup>"... big brother?"</sup></p>
<p id="L95"><br></p>
<p id="L96">I'm still not ready to be a big brother. Realizing this, I chuckled and took Amae into my arms once more.<br><sup>俺もお兄ちゃんとしてはまだまだ未熟。それが分かり、苦笑しながらアマエをもう一度俺の腕の中に抱き寄せた。</sup><br><sup>I'm still immature as an older brother.I found out and hugged Amae again in my arms with a wry smile.</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98"><br></p>
<p id="L99">"If you don't know what it means, you need to be big and strong enough to know what it means. If you don't know what that means, then you need to grow up and be strong enough to know what it means." "Don't stay spoiled by your sisters and uncles. ...... When you grow up to the point where Yamidire and Kuron bow to you and say, 'Amae, please come with us' and 'stay with us'... ...I'm sure we can all be together again."<br><sup>「分からないなら、そのことがどういうことなのか分かるぐらい、お前も大きく、そして強くなんねーとな。いつまでも姉ちゃんやおじさんたちに甘えてんじゃなくて……いつかヤミディレやクロンが『アマエ、是非一緒に来てくれ』、『一緒に居てくれ』って頭下げるぐらいに成長したら……必ず皆がまた一緒に居られる」</sup><br><sup>"If you don't know, you're big and strong enough to know what it means.Don't be spoiled by your sisters and uncles forever... Someday, if Yamidile and Cron grow up to say, 'Amae, please come with me' and 'Stay with me'... everyone will definitely be with me again."</sup></p>
<p id="L100"><br></p>
<p id="L101">"Harder?　Are you going to be strong?　Like the ...... ladies?"<br><sup>「つよく？　つよくなるの？　……おねーちゃんたちみたいに？」</sup><br><sup>"Strong? Are you going to get stronger? ... like the older brothers?"</sup></p>
<p id="L102"><br></p>
<p id="L103">"Oh. And more. Tsukushi's sister and Ma Chou are both trying to grow stronger and bigger now at ....... I hope we can all be together again. Amae, you need to see how hard everyone is working and realize that for yourself."<br><sup>「ああ。そしてもっとだ。ツクシの姉さんもマチョウさんも……今はもっともっと強く大きくなろうとしてる。皆でまた一緒になれるようにな。アマエ、お前は皆のその頑張る姿を見て、自分でも気づかなくちゃいけないんだ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, and more.Both Tsukushi's sister and Macho... Now they're trying to grow stronger and bigger.I hope we can all be together again.Amae, you have to notice yourself when you see everyone working hard."</sup></p>
<p id="L104"><br></p>
<p id="L105"><br></p>
<p id="L106">That's right. That's what Machou-san, Tsukushi's sister, and the others at the dojo all vowed to do when they parted ways.<br><sup>そうだ。マチョウさんやツクシの姉さん、そして道場の連中も、皆が別れの時にそう誓っていた。</sup><br><sup>That's right. Matthew, Tsukushi's sister, and the people at the dojo swore so when they parted.</sup></p>
<p id="L107">I'm sure that everyone in Kakurettele can feel that.<br><sup>その想いは必ずカクレテールに居る皆にも伝わっているはずだ。</sup><br><sup>That feeling must have been conveyed to everyone in Kakretail.</sup></p>
<p id="L108">Even the motleyards must have received that intention.<br><sup>モトリアージュたちだってその意思を受け取ってるはずだ。</sup><br><sup>I'm sure the motriages understand that intention.</sup></p>
<p id="L109">So, even for Amae, who has been allowed to be this tiny and spoiled by everyone until now: ......<br><sup>だから、こんなちっちゃくて皆に甘えることを今まで許容されていたアマエにも……</sup><br><sup>So even for Amae, who had been allowed to be so small and spoiled by everyone...</sup></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111"><br></p>
<p id="L112">"We're all trying to do our best to be that way. So why don't we try harder, Amae?"<br><sup>「皆、そうなるために頑張ろうとしてるんだ。だから、アマエも頑張ろうぜ？」</sup><br><sup>"Everyone is trying hard to be like that.So let's do our best, Amae, too."</sup></p>
<p id="L113"><br></p>
<p id="L114">"I don't know. ...... But when ...... Amae gets big and strong, will we all be together forever?　Is that true?　If Amae gets bigger and stronger, we'll all be together forever?"<br><sup>「分かんない……でも……アマエが、おっきく、つよくなったら皆ずっと一緒？　ほんとなの？　アマエがつよくなればいいの？」</sup><br><sup>"I don't know... but... when Amae gets bigger and stronger, we'll all be together forever?Really? Should Amae get stronger?"</sup></p>
<p id="L115"><br></p>
<p id="L116">"Be strong, Amae. I want you to be so strong that you won't have to worry about anything when we're all together. Then I'll be sure to rely on you. I'm sure I'll be able to rely on you. "You're no good without Amae, you know that?<br><sup>「強くなってくれよ、アマエ。皆が一緒に居ても何も心配いらなくなるぐらい。そうしたら俺だって必ずお前を頼る。『おにーちゃんはアマエが居ないとダメだ』なんつってな！」</sup><br><sup>"Be strong, Amae.You don't have to worry about anything even if everyone is with you.Then I'll definitely rely on you.'My brother must have Amae!'What do you said!"</sup></p>
<p id="L117"><br></p>
<p id="L118"><br></p>
<p id="L119">To help you become more resilient, please visit ......<br><sup>もっと逞しくなってもらうためにも……</sup><br><sup>To make you stronger...</sup></p>
<p id="L120"><br></p>
<p id="L121"><br></p>
<p id="L122">"I'll work harder. I'll get stronger. You too, Cron. Right?"<br><sup>「俺も頑張るよ。もっと強くなる。クロンもだ。だろ？」</sup><br><sup>"I'll do my best, too.It gets stronger.Cron, too, right?"</sup></p>
<p id="L123"><br></p>
<p id="L124">"Of course!　Amae, I'm weak, too. That's why I have to be strong. To protect what is important. In order to be able to protect them. I have to work hard from now on."<br><sup>「もちろんです！　アマエ、私もね、弱いのです。だから強くなるのです。大切なものを守るため。守れるようになるため。これから頑張らないといけないのです」</sup><br><sup>"Of course! Amae, I'm weak, too.That's why it gets stronger.To protect what is important.To be able to protect.I have to do my best from now on."</sup></p>
<p id="L125"><br></p>
<p id="L126"><br></p>
<p id="L127">I smiled as best I could at Amae and called out to Kron, who nodded as if it was obvious.<br><sup>俺は精一杯の笑みをアマエに見せ、クロンにも声を掛け、クロンも当然だと頷いた。</sup><br><sup>I smiled as hard as I could, spoke to Cron, and nodded, "Cron deserves it."</sup></p>
<p id="L128"><br></p>
<p id="L129">"...... oni-chan ...... oni-goddess ...... amae is ...... ugh ...... Ugh~......"<br><sup>「……おにーちゃん……女神さま……アマエは……うぅ……うぅ～……」</sup><br><sup>"...big brother...goddess...amae...wow...wow...wow..."</sup></p>
<p id="L130"><br></p>
