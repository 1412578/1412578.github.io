<p id="L1">For me, it's been a few months since I've seen him.<br><sup>俺からすれば数か月ぶりの再会。</sup><br><sup>It's been a few months since we met again.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">But not for these guys, I guess.<br><sup>だが、こいつらにとってはそうではないだろう。</sup><br><sup>But I don't think that's the case with these people.</sup></p>
<p id="L3"><br></p>
<p id="L4">"You're ...... Bro!　Aren't you a bro!"<br><sup>「あなたは……ブロッ！　ブロではないですか！」</sup><br><sup>"You're... Bro! You're Bro!"</sup></p>
<p id="L5">"Oh~...... bro ......"<br><sup>「お～……ブロ……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh... Bro..."</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">When Bro appeared and smiled at him, Kron ran up to him with a big smile on his face, and Amae, looking surprised, trotted up to him.<br><sup>現れてニカっと笑うブロに、クロンは満面の笑みを浮かべて駆け寄り、アマエも驚いた顔しながらもトコトコと駆け寄った。</sup><br><sup>Clon ran to Bro with a big smile on his face, and Amae ran to him with a surprised face.</sup></p>
<p id="L8"><br></p>
<p id="L9">"All right, all right, sister!　And ......, are you Amae?　Oh, you're still so tiny!"<br><sup>「かっかっかっか、いよう、妹分！　んで……お前さんは、アマエか？　おお～、相変わらずちっこいな～」</sup><br><sup>"Let's be lively, let's be younger sister!"So... are you Amae?Oh, you're as small as ever~"</sup></p>
<p id="L10">"Wow, Bro!　It's a real Bro!　Have a nice day!"<br><sup>「うわ～、ブロ！　本物のブロです！　ごきげんよう！」</sup><br><sup>"Wow, bro! It's a real bro! Have a good day!"</sup></p>
<p id="L11">"Amae, you're getting bigger. I'm going to get stronger."<br><sup>「アマエ、おっきくなったもん。これからつよくなるもん」</sup><br><sup>"Aamae, you've grown up.I'm going to get stronger now."</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">Bro crumples their heads vigorously with his hand.<br><sup>その手で豪快に二人の頭をクシャクシャ撫でるブロ。</sup><br><sup>With that hand, he stroked their heads vigorously.</sup></p>
<p id="L14"><br></p>
<p id="L15">"Oh, my God, Bro!"<br><sup>「あ、んもう、ブロ！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my God, Bro!"</sup></p>
<p id="L16">"No, stop!　No!　Bro, stop!<br><sup>「ん、やめる！　ん！　ブロ、やめる！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, I'm not going to do it!Bro, I'm not going to do it!"</sup></p>
<p id="L17"><br></p>
<p id="L18">Kron tickles it, and Amae looks annoyed, but not really annoyed.<br><sup>クロンはそれをくすぐったそうに、そしてアマエはウザったそうにしながらも実際は満更でもなさそうな顔をしている。</sup><br><sup>Cron seemed to tickle it, and Amae looked annoyed but not really late.</sup></p>
<p id="L19"><br></p>
<p id="L20">"Sister. How have you been?　And ......, like I said before, you've got really tough eyes, huh?　You're getting stronger."<br><sup>「妹分。元気だったか？　それに……さっきも言ったが、本当に逞しい目をしてるぜ？　強くなったんだな」</sup><br><sup>"How have you been, sister?And... as I said before, you have really strong eyes, don't you?You've gotten stronger."</sup></p>
<p id="L21">"Is that so?　I made a promise to you. ...... "It's good to be a good girl, but let's also be strong. ...... I'm glad if I'm fulfilling that promise."<br><sup>「そうなのですか？　あなたとの約束……『イイ子でいるのもいいけど、強くもなろう』……その約束を果たせているのなら、嬉しいです」</sup><br><sup>"Is that so?A promise with you... 'It's okay to be a good boy, but let's be strong.'... I'd be happy if I could fulfill that promise."</sup></p>
<p id="L22">"Oh!　You've been through a lot. ...... Nice meeting you too."<br><sup>「おう！　色々あったんだな……イイ出会いも」</sup><br><sup>"Oh! There were a lot of things... even good encounters."</sup></p>
<p id="L23">"Yes!　I also learned that it's called love!"<br><sup>「はい！　恋というのも知りました！」</sup><br><sup>"Yes! I knew it was love!"</sup></p>
<p id="L24">"Oh, I'm so glad to hear that!　It's kind of a relief to hear you talk about your love life!<br><sup>「おっ、そいつは嬉しいね～！　お前さんのコイバナを聞けるとは、何だか安心するぜ！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, I'm glad to hear that,"~! I'm kind of relieved to hear your coybana!"</sup></p>
<p id="L25"><br></p>
<p id="L26">It was the first time I'd seen these guys together, and yet the scene seemed so natural and relaxing.<br><sup>こいつらが一緒にいる光景は初めて見るのに、やけにその光景が自然に見えてほっこりした。</sup><br><sup>I've never seen them together before, and I'm so happy to see them so naturally.</sup></p>
<p id="L27"><br></p>
<p id="L28">"Is he a friend of ...... yours?"<br><sup>「彼は……君らの友達かい？」</sup><br><sup>"Is he... your friend?"</sup></p>
<p id="L29">"Hmm?　Hmmm... ...... Well, ......."<br><sup>「ん？　ん～……まぁ……な」</sup><br><sup>"Huh? Huh... well... well..."</sup></p>
<p id="L30">"Hmm. He's a pretty good guy. ......"<br><sup>「ふむ。なかなか良い男じゃないか……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, he's a pretty good man..."</sup></p>
<p id="L31"><br></p>
<p id="L32">On the other hand, the prince had never met Bro before, but he seemed to have a not so bad impression of him.<br><sup>一方で、ブロと初対面の王子だが、それほど悪くない印象を受けたようだ。</sup><br><sup>On the other hand, although he met Bro for the first time, he did not seem to have a bad impression.</sup></p>
<p id="L33">Well, Bro is a guy who tries to get inside people's heads with impunity, so he's annoying in some ways, but he's not a bad guy either.<br><sup>まっ、ブロは人の内側に平然と入り込もうとしてくる奴だから、ウザったいところもあるが、悪い奴でもないからな。</sup><br><sup>Well, Bro is a guy who tries to get inside people calmly, so he's annoying, but he's not a bad guy.</sup></p>
<p id="L34">But in the meantime, ......<br><sup>だが、そんな中で……</sup><br><sup>But in the midst of that...</sup></p>
<p id="L35"><br></p>
<p id="L36">"Hey, Eartha Ragan."<br><sup>「おい、アース・ラガン」</sup><br><sup>"Hey, Earth Lagan,"</sup></p>
<p id="L37">"Hmm?"<br><sup>「ん？」</sup><br><sup>"Huh?"</sup></p>
<p id="L38">"You said you wouldn't be working with us anymore. ...... You're not going to let him protect Master Kron instead of you, are you?"<br><sup>「お前は今後我らと共に行動しないと言っていたが……まさか、そのお前の代わりに、こいつにクロン様を守らせるつもりか？」</sup><br><sup>"You said you wouldn't act with us in the future... but are you going to let him protect Mr. Cron instead of you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L39">"Don't ...... Kron. It's Kron and you, both of you."<br><sup>「クロンを……じゃねぇ。クロンとあんた、二人ともをだ」</sup><br><sup>"Cron... well,"Cron and you, both of course.</sup></p>
<p id="L40">"...... what?"<br><sup>「……なに？」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42">Yamidire looked disgruntled, as if snickering and looking down at the Bro who had appeared.<br><sup>現れたブロを鼻で笑って見下すかのように、ヤミディレは不満そうな表情を浮かべた。</sup><br><sup>Yamidile looked displeased as if he were looking down on Bro, who appeared with a snort.</sup></p>
<p id="L43">Yes, that was the suggestion from Parisi.<br><sup>そう、それがパリピからの提案だった。</sup><br><sup>Yes, that was Paripi's suggestion.</sup></p>
<p id="L44"><br></p>
<p id="L45">"It looks like Bro was protected by Mikado Zee in Kanteidan and was in the Imperial Capital. ......<br><sup>「ブロはカンティーダンでミカドのジーさんに保護されて、帝都に居たみたいなんだけどな……」</sup><br><sup>"Bro seems to have been in the imperial capital protected by Mikado's Zee in Kantidan..."</sup></p>
<p id="L46">"What?　Mikado's?"<br><sup>「なに？　ミカドの？」</sup><br><sup>"What? Mikado's?"</sup></p>
<p id="L47">"But the parents of a former classmate of mine who was a Parisian spy did some backstabbing and got Bro released before he left the capital. But Coman's ...... parents of a former classmate of mine who was a Parisian spy had apparently arranged for Bro to be released before he left the capital. I'm sure you'll be glad to know that I'm not the only one who's had a bad day.<br><sup>「ああ。でもコマンの……あ～、パリピのスパイだった俺の元クラスメートの親がな、帝都を離れる前に裏工作してブロを釈放してたみたいなんだよな。んで、そのブロとここで待ち合わせし、今後はあんたたちと一緒に行動してもらおうってな」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, but Coman's... oh, it seems that my former classmate's parents, who were spies of Paris, secretly worked with Bro before leaving the imperial capital and released him.So I'm going to meet him here and ask him to act with you in the future."</sup></p>
<p id="L48">"...... Nuh ...... what ...... I didn't know I was talking to a Parisian like that ......."<br><sup>「……ぬっ……なんと……パリピとそんな話をしていたとは……」</sup><br><sup>"...uh...oh my gosh...I can't believe I was talking to Parisi like that..."</sup></p>
<p id="L49"><br></p>
<p id="L50">This proposal was made to me when I talked to a Parisian through a magic crystal in the sky world.<br><sup>天空世界で魔水晶を通じてパリピと話をした時に出されたこの提案。</sup><br><sup>This proposal was made when I talked to Paripi through the Magic Crystal in the sky.</sup></p>
<p id="L51">It was annoying to follow his suggestion, to say the least, but considering the future of Kron and the others, I thought it would be more reassuring to have Bro with us, so I had no choice but to go along with the suggestion.<br><sup>あいつの提案に従うのはハッキリ言ってムカつくところだが、それでもクロンたちの今後を考えたら、ブロと一緒に居てもらった方が安心度も増すと思い、仕方なく提案に乗ることにした。</sup><br><sup>It's clearly annoying to follow his suggestion, but considering the future of the clones, I thought it would be safer to be with Bro, so I had no choice but to accept it.</sup></p>
<p id="L52">However, Yamidire had a subtle look on his face when he heard about it.<br><sup>だが、ヤミディレはその話を聞いて、微妙な顔を浮かべていた。</sup><br><sup>But when he heard the story, his face was delicate.</sup></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54">"Yeah, it's ......, but it's ...... crap."<br><sup>「そうか……だが……くだらんな」</sup><br><sup>"I see... but... it's no use."</sup></p>
<p id="L55">"I'm not good enough for you, am I?　Master."<br><sup>「俺じゃ、不満っすかい？　師範」</sup><br><sup>"Am I not satisfied?"Master,"</sup></p>
<p id="L56">"Don't make me laugh, Bro. You ran away from the dojo and played around in the outside world. ...... You're far inferior to Machou, let alone Earth Ragan, and you think you can protect us?"<br><sup>「笑わせるな、ブロ。道場から飛び出して、外の世界で遊び惚けていたお前が……アース・ラガンはおろか、マチョウよりも遥かに劣るお前が、我々を守るだと？」</sup><br><sup>"Don't make me laugh, Bro.You were running out of the dojo and playing in the outside world... you're much inferior to Macho, let alone Earth Lagan, to protect us?"</sup></p>
<p id="L57"><br></p>
<p id="L58">Bro. Yamidire's harsh words made him chuckle.<br><sup>ヤミディレのその手厳しい言葉には、流石にブロも苦笑した。</sup><br><sup>As expected, Bro smiled bitterly at the harsh words of Yamidile.</sup></p>
<p id="L59"><br></p>
<p id="L60">"Well, well, well. You're as strict as ever, Master."<br><sup>「かっかっかっか、相変わらず厳しいっすね、師範は」</sup><br><sup>"You're as strict as ever, Master,"</sup></p>
<p id="L61">"Oh, my God, Yami Dire!　I don't think you can say that!　Bro is very dependable, isn't he?"<br><sup>「んもう、ヤミディレ！　そんな言い方は無いと思います！　ブロはとっても頼もしいですよ？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my God! I don't think there's a way to say that!Bro is very reliable, isn't it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L62">"'No, no, no, it's okay, sister. I know what I'm capable of, too."<br><sup>「いやいや、いいんだよ、妹分。俺も俺の力は分かってるからよ」</sup><br><sup>"No, no, it's all right, sister.I know my strength, too."</sup></p>
<p id="L63">"So, but ......"<br><sup>「で、でも……」</sup><br><sup>"But..."</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">Kron puffed out his cheeks at Yamidire's words and was about to get angry, but Bro stopped him.<br><sup>クロンがヤミディレの言葉に頬を膨らませて怒ろうとしたが、それをブロが制して止めた。</sup><br><sup>Cron tried to get angry at Yamidile's words, but Bro stopped him.</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">"That's right, Master. I ran out there. By seeing the outside world that Master came to, ...... he wanted me to know the same world. ......"<br><sup>「その通りだ、師範。俺は外へ飛び出した。師範が来た外の世界を見ることで……俺も同じ世界を知りたいってな……」</sup><br><sup>"That's right,I ran out.By looking at the outside world where the master came...I want to know the same world..."</sup></p>
<p id="L68">"..............."<br><sup>「……………」</sup><br><sup>「……………」</sup></p>
<p id="L69">"And it made me realize how big the world of adults and power and society is, and how small I am.<br><sup>「そして、大人たちの世界、力、社会のデカさを思い知らされ、同時に自分がいかにちっちぇかも分かったんだ」</sup><br><sup>"And I was reminded of the world, the power and the greatness of society of adults, and at the same time I realized how cheesy I was."</sup></p>
<p id="L70">"Hmm. Then ----"<br><sup>「ふん。ならば――――」</sup><br><sup>"Well, then --"</sup></p>
<p id="L71"><br></p>
<p id="L72">In a way, Yamidire's words are correct.<br><sup>ヤミディレの言葉はある意味で正しい。</sup><br><sup>In a sense, Yamidile's words are correct.</sup></p>
<p id="L73">As of a few months ago, I've won a tie with Bro.<br><sup>数カ月前の時点で、俺はブロとのタイマンで勝っている。</sup><br><sup>As of a few months ago, I beat Bro in Taiman.</sup></p>
<p id="L74">Bro is not weak.<br><sup>ブロは弱くない。</sup><br><sup>Bro is not weak.</sup></p>
<p id="L75">But that's the thing, compared to the Rokuga class like Parisi and Yamidire, you can't help but ...... but not ...... there.<br><sup>だが、それこそパリピやヤミディレのような六覇クラスと比べるとどうしても……でも……そこじゃねーんだ。</sup><br><sup>But that's really the case compared to the six hegemony classes like Parisi and Yamidile... but... not there.</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">"But you see, Master. It's true that I'm still weak right now. If it were a simple matter of fighting strength, I would have been able to make more of a difference with my brothers in the past few months. Besides, I don't have the eyes that my sisters and Shihan have."<br><sup>「でもな、師範。確かに今の俺はまだ弱い。単純な戦闘力だったら、この数カ月で兄弟との力の差ももっとできちまっただろうな。ましてや俺には妹分や師範が持っているような眼もない」</sup><br><sup>"But, master, I'm still weak now.If it had been simple combat power, I would have had more power differences with my brothers in the last few months.What's more, I don't have the eyes of a younger sister or a teacher."</sup></p>
<p id="L78">"Oh ...... you know what I mean."<br><sup>「ああ……分かっているではないか」</sup><br><sup>"Oh... you know what I mean, don't you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L79">"But... ......<br><sup>「だけどな……」</sup><br><sup>"But..."</sup></p>
<p id="L80">"What?"<br><sup>「？」</sup><br><sup>「？」</sup></p>
<p id="L81">"I've lived my life outside the home, and I've dealt with all kinds of people, front and back, so I've learned ...... how to stay out of trouble ...... and how to have fun. I've also learned how to have fun.<br><sup>「外でそれなりに生活し、表も裏もひっくるめて色んな連中と付き合ってきたから……どうやったらトラブルを起こさないか……うまく収められるか……そのうえで、どうやって楽しむのかも学んできたつもりだ」</sup><br><sup>"I've lived outside in my own way, and I've been dating a lot of people, both inside and outside... how to make trouble... how to get rid of it well... and how to enjoy it."</sup></p>
<p id="L82">"...... what?"<br><sup>「……なに？」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">Bro has experience.<br><sup>ブロには経験がある。</sup><br><sup>Bro has experience.</sup></p>
<p id="L85">More than anyone here, including myself, I have lived in the world and society, both in the front and the back, sometimes getting into trouble with them, sometimes getting along with them.<br><sup>俺も含めてここに居る誰よりも、表も裏も含めて世間や社会の中で生き、時にはそれらと揉め事を起こすこともあれば、うまく付き合ってきたりもしている。</sup><br><sup>I live in the world and society, both on the outside and on the inside, and sometimes I get into trouble and get along with them better than anyone else here, including myself.</sup></p>
<p id="L86">It's an experience and knowledge that even Yamidire, who has been in Kakuretail almost since the end of the war, doesn't have.<br><sup>それは、戦後からほぼずっとカクレテールに居たヤミディレにもない経験や知識。</sup><br><sup>This is the experience and knowledge that Yamidire, who has been in Kakretail for almost all the time since the end of World War II, does not have.</sup></p>
<p id="L87">Yes, from now on, what we need is not only the ability to protect Yamidire and Kron from trouble, but also someone who can successfully prevent them from causing trouble in the first place.<br><sup>そう、これから必要なのは、ヤミディレやクロンをトラブルから守る実力だけではなく、そもそもトラブルを起こさせないようにうまくできる奴が必要なんだ。</sup><br><sup>Well, what we need from now on is not only the ability to protect yamidire and clon from trouble, but also the ability to do well so that they don't cause trouble in the first place.</sup></p>
<p id="L88">Sure, he was a brawling delinquent who was essentially an outcast from the world, but he had a lot of friends, and he hung out with a lot of adults.<br><sup>確かにこいつは本来世間からのはみ出し者でもある喧嘩好きの不良だが、友達は多かったし、色んな大人たちとも付き合っていた。</sup><br><sup>It is true that this is a quarrelsome villain, who is also an out-of-the-way person, but he had many friends and was dating many different adults.</sup></p>
<p id="L89">And on top of it all, this guy was enjoying life.<br><sup>そして、その上でこいつは楽しんで生きていた。</sup><br><sup>And on top of that he lived happily ever after.</sup></p>
<p id="L90">He had a lot on his mind behind the scenes, and he had some weird agendas and policies, but still, when it came to Kuron and Yamidire, it was clear what his priorities were.<br><sup>まっ、その裏では色々と抱え込んだり、変な意地やポリシーを持っていたりしたが、それでもクロンとヤミディレが絡むのであれば、こいつが何を優先するかは明らかだ。</sup><br><sup>Well, behind the scenes, he had a lot of strange wills and policies, but if Cron and Yamidire are still involved, it's clear what he'll give priority to.</sup></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92"><br></p>
<p id="L93">"Of course, I'll be strong enough to defend you with my body when the time comes. But for now, why don't we have some ...... fun together?　Forget about what you've been carrying for more than ten years. ...... Of course, I'll carry the heavy burden that you can't forget.<br><sup>「もちろん、俺だってイザという時は体を張ってあんたらを守れるぐらい強くなるさ。だけど今は一緒に……楽しまねーっすか？　十数年も背負ってたもんも、少しは忘れて……もちろん、忘れられねぇ重い荷物は俺も一緒に背負うっすよ」</sup><br><sup>"Of course, I'll be strong enough to stand up and protect you in time of Isa.But now... together... don't you enjoy it?I've been carrying it for more than a decade, but I forgot a little... of course, I can't forget it.I'll carry heavy luggage with you."</sup></p>
<p id="L94"><br></p>
<p id="L95">"What the hell is ......?"<br><sup>「……なんだと？」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L96"><br></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">What I feel from the current bro is completely different from the kind of unintelligible delinquent's willpower I used to feel, which is to say, a man's willpower.<br><sup>今のブロから感じるのは、以前のように意味不明な不良の意地みたいなもんとは全く違う、言うなれば男の意地。</sup><br><sup>What I feel from the bro now is completely different from the meaningless bad will like before, in other words, the male will.</sup></p>
<p id="L99">I felt a definite heat in his words.<br><sup>その言葉には確かな熱を感じた。</sup><br><sup>I felt a certain enthusiasm for the words.</sup></p>
<p id="L100"><br></p>
<p id="L101">"'Bro ...... you ...... changed a bit?　There was a time when I left Kakretele and came back to the dojo for a short period of time to train with some of the outside people. ...... At that time, I was somewhat obsessed with the stupid delinquent way of life, while I was burnt out from destroying the ...... mafia. I was burned out by the destruction of the ...... mafia and had more of a boring, rotten look in my eyes. ......"<br><sup>「ブロ……お前……少し変わったか？　カクレテールを出て、たまに道場に外の連中を連れて短期間修行をしに戻ってきたときもあったが……その時はどこか、くだらん不良という生き方にこだわる一方で……マフィアの壊滅で燃え尽きたり……もっと、つまらん腐った目をしていたのだがな……」</sup><br><sup>"Bro... you... have you changed a little?"Sometimes I left Kakretail and came back to the dojo to train for a short time... on the other hand, I was obsessed with the way I lived... burned out by the destruction of the mafia... with more boring rotten eyes..."</sup></p>
<p id="L102"><br></p>
<p id="L103">Yamidire also felt that heat from Bro and looked a little strange.<br><sup>ヤミディレも、ブロのその熱を感じ、少し不思議そうな表情を浮かべていた。</sup><br><sup>Yamidile also felt Bro's fever and looked a little strange.</sup></p>
<p id="L104">In response to that question, Bro glanced at me and said, ......<br><sup>その問いに対して、ブロはチラッと俺を見て……</sup><br><sup>In response to that question, Bro glanced at me...</sup></p>
<p id="L105"><br></p>
<p id="L106"><br></p>
<p id="L107">"Of course, I forgot my initial intentions when I ...... ventured out into the world, and I was rotten and boring, but you ...... beat me up as hard as you could and gave me the boot. ...because I met the coolest friend ever!<br><sup>「そりゃもちろん……外の世界に飛び出した時の初心を忘れて、腐ってつまらくなっていた俺を……思いっきり殴ってボコボコにして引導を渡してくれた……最高にイカしたダチと出会えたからっすよ！」</sup><br><sup>"Of course... I forgot my original intention when I ran out into the outside world, and he hit me as hard as he could and gave me guidance... because I met the coolest dachi!"</sup></p>
<p id="L108"><br></p>
<p id="L109">"...... nuh ...... mmm ...... mmm ......"<br><sup>「……ぬっ……む……むぅ……」</sup><br><sup>"...uh...uh...uh...uh...uh..."</sup></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111"><br></p>
<p id="L112">His straight and piercing eyes were something that the smoldering Bro didn't have at that time.<br><sup>その真っすぐでギラギラした眼は、あのとき燻っていたブロには無かったもの。</sup><br><sup>His straight and glistening eyes were not in the smoky bro at that time.</sup></p>
<p id="L113">Rather, I guess this is the original Bro.<br><sup>むしろ、これが本来のブロなんだろうな。</sup><br><sup>Rather, I guess this is the original bro.</sup></p>
<p id="L114">Yamidire didn't say another word as the heat of the moment got to him, and then Bro looked at me again, smiled and stuck his thumb up in the air.<br><sup>ヤミディレもその熱に押された様子でもう何も言わず、そしてブロはもう一度俺を見て、ニカっと笑って親指を突き上げた。</sup><br><sup>Yamidile looked pressed by the fever and said nothing more, and Bro looked at me again and grinned and raised his thumb.</sup></p>
<p id="L115"><br></p>
<p id="L116">I felt a little itchy, but I smiled and nodded back, thinking once again that I could trust the current Bro with my life.<br><sup>ちょっとムズ痒い気もしたが、俺は改めて、今のブロなら安心して任せられるなと思って、俺も笑って頷き返した。</sup><br><sup>I felt a little itchy, but I laughed and nodded back thinking that I could leave the current bro to you with peace of mind.</sup></p>

<p id="La1">Thank you very much for your help. I've been able to update today without refraining from writing. I'm very grateful to the many people who have come to my site recently, either because of my comicalization or because of my self-restraint. I'm an elegant straight writer whose only merit is that I'm serious, but I'd be very happy if you could keep in touch with me. If you think this work is interesting, I would be more than happy if you could give me a "★" below to my ...... soul.<br><sup>お世話になっております。まだ自粛せずに今日も更新することが出来ました。最近はコミカライズからの流れだったり、外出自粛故にこちらに来て頂ける方が多く、大変恐縮に存じます。真面目なだけが取り柄の上品なノンケ作家の私ではありますが、これからもお付き合いいただけましたら幸甚にございます。あっ、本作を面白いと思っていただけたら下の「★」を私のケ……魂にブッ刺して戴けましたらもっと悦びます。</sup><br><sup>Thank you for your help.I was able to update it again today without self-restraint.I am very sorry that there are many people who come here to refrain from going out these days because of course.As an elegant non-ke writer, I would appreciate it if you could continue to work with me.Oh, if you find this work interesting, I'd be more happy if you could stab ★ below into my soul.</sup></p>

<p id="La3">I'm going to change the subject, but I actually have a request today. I've been in touch with my father at home a lot lately, and he's been bragging to everyone he knows about the comicalization as a clear achievement. There is one thing I would like to ask you, though: please don't report to my father even what I write in the postcards. The thing, the thing, the thing, the thing, ...... please, ...... please, please, please!　Thank you!　They ask me awkward questions on the phone!<br><sup>話しが変わりますが、実は今日はお願いがあります。最近はこういう状況ですので実家の親父ともよく連絡を取り合っているのですが、コミカライズというのは分かりやすい実績として親父は色々と知り合いに自慢しているそうで、中には律義に本を買ったり、こちらのＷＥＢも読んでくださっている人も居るようで、大変恐縮にございます。ただ、一つお願いがあるのですが、あとがきで私が書いている内容まで親父には報告しないでくださいませ。アレとかアレとかアレとか……どうか……どうか、お願いします！　おたのもうします！　電話で気まずい質問されたりするのです！</sup><br><sup>By the way, I have a favor to ask of you today.Recently, I have been in touch with my parents' father a lot, but he brags about his comicalization to his acquaintances, and I am very sorry that some people buy books and read this web page in good faith.However, I have a favor to ask you, but please don't report to my father what I'm writing later.Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</sup></p>

<p id="La5">Well, that's a request to certain people, and the other thing is that various bookstores are refraining from doing business this April, and that can't be helped. However, for authors who publish books in April, it's a terrible situation. I was safe because my book was published last month, but for those who are unlucky enough to have a baby this time of year, it's a matter of life and death. I'm not saying that you have to buy the books, but if you have time, please take an interest in what's on sale this time of year, read the novels on Shosetsuka ni Narou, and if you like them, buy them. If they don't, the publishing industry will be in the red, and it will shrink, and I won't be able to publish more volumes (honestly)!　　No one will be able to see Yosei's character drawings!　Also, Kuron and Amae. So I've written a lazy postcard, but this is the situation, so please forgive me!　You're welcome to buy the book!<br><sup>さて、それは特定の人へのお願いで、もう一つはこの四月は色々な本屋さんが営業を自粛されていますし、それは仕方ありません。とはいえ、四月に書籍を出版される作家先生たちからすればシャレにならん状況です。私は先月だったのでセーフではありましたが、運悪くこの時期に出産する方々は死活問題です。流石に買ってとまでは言いませんが、時間があるときには「この時期は何が発売なのかな～」ぐらいの興味を持っていただき、そのうえで小説家になろう内の小説を読んで、それがハマったら買って戴けたらと思います。そうでなければ、出版業界は大赤字で、縮小され、ワシも続巻出せなくなる（本音）！　　ヨーセイのキャラ絵を誰も見れなくなる！　あと、クロンとアマエ。ので、ダラダラとあとがき書きましたが、こういう状況ですので許してつかーさい！　本は買占め大歓迎です！</sup><br><sup>Well, that's a request for a particular person, and the other thing is that many bookstores are closed this April, and that can't be helped.However, for writers who publish books in April, it is no joke.It was safe for me because it was last month, but unfortunately, those who give birth at this time of year are a matter of life and death.As expected, I won't tell you to buy it, but when you have time, you will be interested in what will be on sale at this time of year, and after that, I would like you to read the novels in my book and buy them if you fall in love with them.Otherwise, the publishing industry will be in the red, shrinking, and the eagle won't be able to publish one after another!　　No one will be able to see Yosei's character paintings!Also, Kron and Amae. So I wrote a lot of postscripts, but please forgive me in this situation!We welcome you to buy up books!</sup></p>
