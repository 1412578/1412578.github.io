<p id="L1">"Earth ...... Fiancé ......"<br><sup>「アース……フィアンセイ……」</sup><br><sup>"Earth... Fiancee..."</sup></p>
<p id="L2">"Aha!　Did I get the talk ...... right?"<br><sup>「あは！　話し……ちゃんとできたのかな？」</sup><br><sup>"Ah! Talk... Did you do it right?"</sup></p>
<p id="L3"><br></p>
<p id="L4">Rival and Fu look surprised as they see us both returning after our conversation.<br><sup>話を終えて戻ってきた俺たち二人を見ながら、リヴァルとフーが驚いた様子を見せる。</sup><br><sup>Rival and Fu look surprised when they see us both back after talking.</sup></p>
<p id="L5">Of course it was. The confusion that had existed between Fiancé and me earlier was gone, and more importantly, the awkward atmosphere that had existed between us was gone.<br><sup>そりゃそうだろう。さっきまでの混乱状態だったフィアンセイ、そして何よりも俺たちの間にあったはずの気まずい雰囲気が無くなっているのだから。</sup><br><sup>That's right.Fiancee, who was in a state of confusion before, and above all, the awkward atmosphere that should have been between us is gone.</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">"Rival, Hu ......, I'm fine now. I'm done talking."<br><sup>「リヴァル、フー……我はもう大丈夫だ。話は済んだ」</sup><br><sup>"Rival, Phu... I'm all right now.I'm done talking."</sup></p>
<p id="L8">"Princess!"<br><sup>「姫様！」</sup><br><sup>"Princess!"</sup></p>
<p id="L9">"Mm-hmm."<br><sup>「うむ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L10">"Earth!　Earth!"<br><sup>「ッ！　アース！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh! Earth!"</sup></p>
<p id="L11"><br></p>
<p id="L12">When Fiancé answered that, Fu instantly jumped at me with a big smile on his face.<br><sup>フィアンセイがそう答えると、フーは途端に満面の笑みを浮かべて俺に飛びついてきた。</sup><br><sup>When Fiancee answered so, Fu immediately jumped at me with a big smile.</sup></p>
<p id="L13"><br></p>
<p id="L14">"Earth!　Good. ...... Good."<br><sup>「アース！　よかった……よかったよぉ」</sup><br><sup>"Earth! I'm glad... I'm glad."</sup></p>
<p id="L15">"Wait, my neck, it's depressing!"<br><sup>「ちょ、おま、首、つか鬱陶しい！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my God, my neck, it's depressing!"</sup></p>
<p id="L16">"I'm really sorry too. ...... I'm sorry. ...... I never realized what Earth was struggling with."<br><sup>「僕も本当にごめんね……ごめんよぉ……アースが何を抱えて悩んでいたのか、全然気づかなかったよぉ」</sup><br><sup>"I'm really sorry too... I'm sorry... I didn't realize what Earth was worried about."</sup></p>
<p id="L17">"Oh, yes, yes, I get it. Don't cry and hug me like a man."<br><sup>「あー、はいはい、分かったよ。つか男のくせに泣いて抱きついてくんなよ」</sup><br><sup>"Ah, yes, yes, I understand.Don't cry and hug me even though you're a man."</sup></p>
<p id="L18">"But thank goodness ...... you made up with the princess, didn't you?　I'm glad ...... really ......."<br><sup>「でも、よかった……姫様と仲直りできたんだね？　よかった……ほんとうに……」</sup><br><sup>"But I'm glad...You made up with the princess, didn't you?I'm glad... really..."</sup></p>
<p id="L19">"Damn it, .......<br><sup>「ったく……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my God..."</sup></p>
<p id="L20"><br></p>
<p id="L21">I thought that studying abroad might have made him a little more robust, but this baby-faced bastard is still the same.<br><sup>留学でこいつも少しは逞しくなったかなと思ったけど、この童顔野郎は相変わらずだ。</sup><br><sup>I thought he got a little stronger after studying abroad, but this kid's face is still the same.</sup></p>
<p id="L22">I don't know what to say, but I don't really care anymore, and I naturally sigh.<br><sup>なんつーか、こうなるともう色々と俺もどうでもよくなってきて、自然とため息が出る。</sup><br><sup>When this happens, I don't care anymore, and I sigh naturally.</sup></p>
<p id="L23">In the midst of all this, Rival was calmly asking Fiancé about the rest of the story.<br><sup>そんな中で、リヴァルは落ち着いた様子でフィアンセイに話の続きを尋ねていた。</sup><br><sup>In the midst of this, Rival was calmly asking Fiancee for more information.</sup></p>
<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25">"So ...... we've talked about ......, what then?"<br><sup>「で……話は済んだ……となるとそれではどうなるのだ？」</sup><br><sup>"And... I'm done talking... what happens then?"</sup></p>
<p id="L26">"Mm, we're back on track. That's what I've decided."<br><sup>「うむ、仕切り直し。そういうことにした」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I'll start over.That's what I decided."</sup></p>
<p id="L27">"What?"<br><sup>「？」</sup><br><sup>「？」</sup></p>
<p id="L28">"Because we don't have enough ...... power to bring ...... Earth back, nor do we have enough ...... power to stand on equal footing with it.<br><sup>「今の我等では……アースを連れ戻すだけの……また……対等に並び立つだけの力もないからな」</sup><br><sup>"We don't have the strength to bring back Earth... or... equal."</sup></p>
<p id="L29">"What?<br><sup>「ッ！？」</sup><br><sup>"What!"</sup></p>
<p id="L30">"You know exactly what you're doing, don't you?　Rival."<br><sup>「お前もよく分かっているのだろう？　リヴァル」</sup><br><sup>"You understand, don't you, Rival?"</sup></p>
<p id="L31"><br></p>
<p id="L32">Rival chokes on his words as Fiancé answers without hesitation and with a fresh expression.<br><sup>迷いなく、清々しい表情で答えるフィアンセイに言葉を詰まらせるリヴァル。</sup><br><sup>Rival chokes Fiancee, who replies with a fresh expression without hesitation.</sup></p>
<p id="L33"><br></p>
<p id="L34">"You still mean ...... or ......."<br><sup>「まだまだ……ということか……」</sup><br><sup>"I mean, it's still a long way off..."</sup></p>
<p id="L35">"Oh, Reval. I've been groping my way through this, not knowing what I'm doing, but I've ...... figured it out, I've realized it, and that's the payoff."<br><sup>「ああ、リヴァル。何も分からぬまま手探りで追いかけてきたが……それが分かった、気付くことが出来た、それだけで収穫だ」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, Rival.I groped for him without knowing anything, but I found out, I could notice, and that was the harvest."</sup></p>
<p id="L36">"And that convinced you to go to ......?<br><sup>「それで……納得を？」</sup><br><sup>"And... are you convinced?"</sup></p>
<p id="L37">"Mm-hmm."<br><sup>「うむ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L38">"............"<br><sup>「…………」</sup><br><sup>「…………」</sup></p>
<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">Rival looks a little complicated at Fiancé's words.<br><sup>フィアンセイの言葉に少し複雑そうなリヴァル。</sup><br><sup>Rival seems a little complicated by Fiancee's words.</sup></p>
<p id="L41">Then he turns to me and asks with a mysterious expression.<br><sup>そして俺と向き合って、神妙な表情で尋ねて来る。</sup><br><sup>Then he faced me and asked me with a mysterious expression.</sup></p>
<p id="L42"><br></p>
<p id="L43">"'Earth ...... are you sure you're done talking?　What Parisi said: ...... we'll hunt you down ----"<br><sup>「アース……本当に話は済んだのか？　パリピが言っていたこと……俺たちがお前を追い詰め――――」</sup><br><sup>"Earth... are you sure you're done talking?"What Paripi was saying... we're going to hunt you down????????"</sup></p>
<p id="L44">"I told you, Reval.　I don't want to talk about it anymore. I've made it right with Fiancé. So it's okay."<br><sup>「リヴァル、言ったろ？　その話はもういいんだ。フィアンセイとキッチリと済ませた。だから、もういいんだ」</sup><br><sup>"I told you, Rival, that's enough.I got through with my fiancee.So that's enough."</sup></p>
<p id="L45"><br></p>
<p id="L46">I'd had enough of that.<br><sup>俺はそのことについてはもう十分だった。</sup><br><sup>I've had enough of it.</sup></p>
<p id="L47">That's what Rival is for me. ......<br><sup>そんな俺にリヴァルは……</sup><br><sup>For me, Rival...</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">"Yeah, ...... but ...... I'm not ...... sorry for imposing my selfish expectations on you, okay?"<br><sup>「そうか……だが……俺は勝手な期待をお前に押し付けたことは……謝らんぞ？」</sup><br><sup>"Well... but... I'm not going to apologize for imposing selfish expectations on you."</sup></p>
<p id="L50">"Hmm?"<br><sup>「ん？」</sup><br><sup>"Huh?"</sup></p>
<p id="L51">"Even if it was a path you didn't want, even if it was an expectation you didn't want,...... even if it was an expectation we didn't want,...... you and we were both born into that kind of family. It's a great way to make sure you're getting the most out of your time with us. ......<br><sup>「たとえ自分が望まぬ道、望まぬ期待だったとしても……俺たちの勝手な期待だったとしても……お前も俺たちもそういう家の子として生まれて来たんだからな……何よりお前は俺たちにとっては、そういう存在だったのだから」</sup><br><sup>"Even if you don't want to go the way you don't want to go, even if it's our own expectation... you and we were both born children of that kind... most of all, you were like that to us."</sup></p>
<p id="L52">"......, that's a tough one."<br><sup>「……ったく、キビシーやつだぜ」</sup><br><sup>"...he's a Kibish fellow,"</sup></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54">It was as if he was saying to me, "Aren't you sweet?" It was as if he was saying to me, "Aren't you sweet?<br><sup>まるで、俺のことを「甘いんじゃないのか？」と言わんばかりだ。</sup><br><sup>It's almost like saying, "Aren't you sweet?"</sup></p>
<p id="L55">Around here, Fiancé seems to be different from Rival.<br><sup>ここらへんは、フィアンセイはリヴァルと違うみたいだ。</sup><br><sup>Around here, Fiancee seems to be different from Rival.</sup></p>
<p id="L56">But ......<br><sup>だけど……</sup><br><sup>But...</sup></p>
<p id="L57"><br></p>
<p id="L58">"But ...... this one is ......."<br><sup>「だが……これだけは……」</sup><br><sup>"But... that's all..."</sup></p>
<p id="L59">"That's it?　What is it?"<br><sup>「これだけ？　なんだ？」</sup><br><sup>"That's it? What is it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">Saying he was not sorry for what the Parisian pointed out to him, Rival meditated and bowed his head just a little ......<br><sup>パリピに指摘されたことについては謝らないと言いつつ、リヴァルは目を瞑ってほんの少しだけ頭を下げ……</sup><br><sup>Rival closed his eyes and bowed only a little, saying he would not apologize for what Paripi pointed out...</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63"><br></p>
<p id="L64">"I couldn't help you ...... that day, I couldn't protect you ...... or stop you ...... today. ...... I couldn't help you ...... talking to your friends ...... I'm sorry ...... I'm sorry.<br><sup>「お前を助けることができなかった……あの日は……お前を庇うことも、止めることもできず……今日は……俺は何の力にもなれなかった……お前の友と語りながら……すまん……」</sup><br><sup>"I couldn't help you... that day... I couldn't protect you or stop you... today... I couldn't help you... while talking to your friend... I'm sorry..."</sup></p>
<p id="L65"><br></p>
<p id="L66">"...... is ......."<br><sup>「は……はは……」</sup><br><sup>"Huh...huh...huh..."</sup></p>
<p id="L67"><br></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">It's not about what you did to push me over the edge. It's about how sorry I am that I couldn't help you.<br><sup>俺を追い詰めた云々ではない。俺の力になれなかったことに対する申し訳なさ。</sup><br><sup>I didn't mean to corner me.I'm sorry I couldn't help you.</sup></p>
<p id="L70">I can feel the clumsy feelings from Rival as he tells me, biting his lip in frustration.<br><sup>悔しそうに唇を噛み締めながら告げるリヴァルから、不器用な想いが伝わってくる。</sup><br><sup>I can feel clumsy thoughts from the rival, which I tell you while biting my lips chagrinedly.</sup></p>
<p id="L71">Apparently Rival: ......<br><sup>リヴァルらしい……</sup><br><sup>Rival-like...</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">"So, Earth."<br><sup>「だから、アース」</sup><br><sup>"So, Earth,"</sup></p>
<p id="L74">"Yes."<br><sup>「おう」</sup><br><sup>"Oh,"</sup></p>
<p id="L75">"...... will surely catch up with you one day."<br><sup>「……いつか必ずお前に追いつく」</sup><br><sup>"...I'll definitely catch up with you someday."</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">And Rival's words were a complete change from the time before the match, as if he wanted me to be his target.<br><sup>そして御前試合前の時とは打って変わり、まるで俺を目標とするかのようなリヴァルの言葉。</sup><br><sup>And Rival's words were very different from those before the game, as if they were aiming for me.</sup></p>
<p id="L78">Didn't this guy give off that "I'm already too much stronger than you" vibe back then?<br><sup>あの時のこいつは、「俺はもうお前より強くなり過ぎた」みたいな空気出してたっけ？</sup><br><sup>Was this guy like, "I'm already stronger than you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L79">And now I'm the target?<br><sup>それが今じゃ俺が目標？</sup><br><sup>Is that my goal now?</sup></p>
<p id="L80">But ......<br><sup>だけど……</sup><br><sup>But...</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">"I'm sorry, but I can't let you catch up. I've got a lot further to go."<br><sup>「残念だが、追いつかせねーよ。俺はもっと先に行ってるからな」</sup><br><sup>"I'm afraid I can't catch up with you.I'm going a long way ahead."</sup></p>
<p id="L83">"Where do you think you're going?　Not as a warrior, not as a ...... brave, but ...... where?"<br><sup>「どこまで行くつもりだ？　戦士としてでもなく……勇者としての道を行くわけでもなく……どこへ？」</sup><br><sup>"How far are you going?"Not as a warrior... not as a brave man... where?"</sup></p>
<p id="L84">"Oh?　That's as far as you can go with something like that!"<br><sup>「あ？　そんなもん、何かに向かってどこまでもだ！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh? That's the way to something!"</sup></p>
<p id="L85"><br></p>
<p id="L86">When I said that, Rival also looked dumbfounded, but his mouth relaxed.<br><sup>俺がそう言うと、リヴァルも呆れたように、しかしその口元が緩んだ。</sup><br><sup>When I said that, Rival was stunned, but his mouth loosened.</sup></p>
<p id="L87"><br></p>
<p id="L88">"Huh, ......, you think you're being cool?　That's not an answer, is it?"<br><sup>「ふっ……カッコつけているつもりか？　答えになってないぞ？」</sup><br><sup>"Hmm... are you going to be cool?"It's not the answer."</sup></p>
<p id="L89">"Huh?　I don't like being called cool by you."<br><sup>「ああん？　お前にカッコつけていると言われるなんて心外だな」</sup><br><sup>"Oh? I'm disappointed to hear that you're pretending to be cool."</sup></p>
<p id="L90">"Hmmm ......, but ...... not bad."<br><sup>「ふふふ……だが……悪くない」</sup><br><sup>"Hmm... but... it's not bad."</sup></p>
<p id="L91">"Rival?"<br><sup>「リヴァル？」</sup><br><sup>"Rival?"</sup></p>
<p id="L92">"Even though you don't know where you're going ...... you're still going a lot further and a lot higher than we are ...... and we're following you like we're being pulled. ...... That's it. ...... The road may be different, but ...... you're okay with that. ...... Earth."<br><sup>「どこへ向かっているか分からずとも……それでもお前は俺たちよりもずっと先へ、ずっと上へ行っている……それを俺たちは引っ張られるように追いかける……それでいい……道は違えども……お前はそれでいいんだ……アース」</sup><br><sup>"Even if you don't know where you're going... but you're still way ahead of us... we're going to be pulled up... that's fine... but you're going to be fine... earth."</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94">Saying that, Rival lightly hits my shoulder with a goo.<br><sup>そう言って、俺の肩を軽くグーで叩くリヴァル。</sup><br><sup>Rival patted me on the shoulder.</sup></p>
<p id="L95">At the time of the game, he was upset that I was going to choose a different path than the heroes, the imperial knights, and my father, but after seeing me now, he seems to be convinced that I'm okay with this.<br><sup>御前試合の時は、俺が勇者や帝国騎士、そして親父とはまるで違う道を選ぼうとしていたことに憤慨していたこいつだけど、今の俺を見て、もう俺はこれでいいと納得してくれたようだ。</sup><br><sup>He was angry at me for trying to choose a completely different path from the brave, the Imperial Knight, and my father at the time of the game, but when he saw me now, he seemed to have convinced me that this was all right.</sup></p>
<p id="L96">And ......<br><sup>そして……</sup><br><sup>And...</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">"I don't know what you're aiming for or who you're going to fight, but ...... next time you're in trouble again, ...... I'll be there to help you this time."<br><sup>「お前が何を目指し、これから誰と戦うかは分からないが……今度お前がまたピンチになった時……今度こそ必ず力になってみせる」</sup><br><sup>"I don't know what you're aiming for and who you're going to fight against from now on, but next time you're in trouble again... I'll definitely help you this time."</sup></p>
<p id="L99"><br></p>
<p id="L100">And it felt like a declaration to myself.<br><sup>そして、それは自分自身への宣言のようにも感じた。</sup><br><sup>And it felt like a declaration to myself.</sup></p>
<p id="L101">Rival himself must have felt a lot of things in this battle, having been kicked around by the strength of the former legends who were on a different level, the Six Supremes, and those who were the rivals of the dads they were aiming for.<br><sup>リヴァル自身も今回の戦いで、六覇というレベル違いのかつての伝説、そして自分たちが目指す親父たちのライバルだった連中の強さに蹴散らされて、色々と感じることがあったんだろうな。</sup><br><sup>In this battle, Rival himself must have felt a lot about being kicked out by the legends of the Six Hegemony level and the strength of the men who were rivals of his fathers.</sup></p>
<p id="L102">He has a look in his eyes that says he's ready to go.<br><sup>なんか、覚悟でも決めたって感じの目をしてやがる。</sup><br><sup>He has eyes that seem to have made up his mind.</sup></p>
<p id="L103">This is the same as Fiancé.<br><sup>これは、フィアンセイと同じだな。</sup><br><sup>It's the same as Fiancee.</sup></p>
<p id="L104"><br></p>
<p id="L105">"Oh, I see. Well, I'm going to be strong enough to handle things on my own, but if that ever happens, I'll rely on you.<br><sup>「おお、そうかい。まっ、俺は一人でも大丈夫なぐらい強くなるつもりだが、もし万が一そういう時があれば頼ってやるよ」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, I see,"Well, I'm going to be strong enough to be alone, but if there's a time like that, I'll rely on you."</sup></p>
<p id="L106">"Oh."<br><sup>「ああ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">I tapped him lightly on the shoulder, too.<br><sup>俺も肩を軽く叩いてやった。</sup><br><sup>I patted him on the shoulder, too.</sup></p>
<p id="L109">Well, this is the first time I've done something like this manly exchange with this guy.<br><sup>そういや、こういう男らしいやり取りみたいなもの、こいつとやったのは初めてだったな。</sup><br><sup>No, I've never had such a manly conversation with him before.</sup></p>
<p id="L110">Really don't see the first side of my childhood friends today.<br><sup>本当に今日は幼馴染たちの初めての面を見るな。</sup><br><sup>Don't look at your childhood friends for the first time today.</sup></p>
<p id="L111"><br></p>
<p id="L112">"Oh, my God!　I want to be part of this!<br><sup>「もう！　僕も仲間に入れてよおお！」</sup><br><sup>"Come on! Let me join you!"</sup></p>
<p id="L113">"Oh, no."<br><sup>「ぬおっ」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my God.</sup></p>
<p id="L114">"Mmm."<br><sup>「むぅ」</sup><br><sup>"Well,"</sup></p>
<p id="L115"><br></p>
<p id="L116">At that moment, Fu, who was still clinging to my neck, reached out and put his hand on Rival's shoulder.<br><sup>そのとき、未だに俺の首にしがみ付いたままのフーが手を伸ばしてリヴァルの肩に手を回した。</sup><br><sup>Then Fu, still clinging to my neck, reached out and put his hand around Rival's shoulder.</sup></p>
<p id="L117"><br></p>
<p id="L118">"Yeah, get away from him!<br><sup>「ええい、離れろ！」</sup><br><sup>"Well, get away!"</sup></p>
<p id="L119">"No, no, no!　Come on, let's all stick together like we used to!"<br><sup>「やだーよー！　ほら、皆で昔みたいにくっついてさ～！」</sup><br><sup>"No! Look, we're all stuck together like we used to!"</sup></p>
<p id="L120">"I've never done anything like that in my life!<br><sup>「って、そんなこと一度もしたことねーだろうが！」</sup><br><sup>`I don't think I've ever done that!'</sup></p>
<p id="L121">"So let's do it now!"<br><sup>「じゃあ、今しようよ！」</sup><br><sup>"Well, let's do it now!"</sup></p>
<p id="L122">"Yea, it's annoying and disgusting."<br><sup>「え～い、うざいうっとうしいきもちわるい」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, it's annoying and disgusting."</sup></p>
<p id="L123">"It's terrible!"<br><sup>「ひどいよ！」</sup><br><sup>"That's terrible!"</sup></p>
<p id="L124">"Yeah, tell me you're trying to be like Fiancé and Rival!　You got ripped to shreds by the Parisians too, so at least try a little ----."<br><sup>「ええい、お前もフィアンセイやリヴァルみたいに頑張るとか言えよな！　お前だってパリピにズタボロにやられたんだから少しは――――」</sup><br><sup>"Well, tell me you'll do your best like Fiancee and Rival!"You've been beaten up by Paripi, so you've got a little????????"</sup></p>
<p id="L125"><br></p>
<p id="L126">The moment I tried to shake off Fu, who, unlike the two of us, seemed to be unable to read the air: ......<br><sup>二人と違って空気読めないようなフーを振り払おうとした瞬間……</sup><br><sup>Unlike them, the moment I tried to shake off the fu that I couldn't read...</sup></p>
<p id="L127"><br></p>
<p id="L128">"It's a given.<br><sup>「当たり前だよ」</sup><br><sup>"Of course,"</sup></p>
<p id="L129">"......, ......?"<br><sup>「……お……？」</sup><br><sup>"...oh...?"</sup></p>
<p id="L130"><br></p>
<p id="L131">But even so, he is also a child of the seven heroes, and he has lived with that pride.<br><sup>だが、それでもやはりこいつもまた七勇者の子供として、そのことを誇りに生きてきた。</sup><br><sup>But still, as a child of the Seven Braves, he lived proudly.</sup></p>
<p id="L132">He's just an optimistic guy who's smiling because he's happy that everyone is making up.<br><sup>皆が仲直りできて良かった良かったでニコニコしているだけの楽観的な奴じゃないか。</sup><br><sup>I'm glad everyone made up.I'm glad you're just optimistic about smiling.</sup></p>
<p id="L133"><br></p>
<p id="L134">"I never want to be left behind. ...... Today ...... I got a glimpse of the world Earth is in now ...... and the world our dads used to fight for. ...... I'll never lose sight of that again."<br><sup>「僕だけ置いていかれるなんて絶対に嫌だ……今日……アースが今いる世界が……そしてかつて僕らのパパたちが戦ってきた世界を垣間見ることが出来たんだ……絶対にもう見失わない」</sup><br><sup>"I definitely don't want to be left alone... today... the world Earth is in right now... and I'll never lose sight of the world our daddy used to fight in."</sup></p>
<p id="L135"><br></p>
<p id="L136">"...... so on."<br><sup>「……そうかい」</sup><br><sup>"...is that so?"</sup></p>

<p id="L138">Well, he's ...... the one who says this, and I'm sure he'll do his best now that he's found a new goal.<br><sup>まっ、こいつが……こいつらがこう言うんだし、新しい目標が見つかったことで頑張るんだろうな。</sup><br><sup>Well, these guys... they say this, and they're going to do their best to find a new goal.</sup></p>
<p id="L139">I'll have to re-train with my master again to make sure I don't catch up.<br><sup>俺も追いつかせねーように、また師匠と鍛えなおしだな。</sup><br><sup>I'll train you again with my teacher so that I can't catch up with you.</sup></p>
<p id="L140">We need to be able to win on our own merits, not just by luck or Treina's strategy like today.<br><sup>今日みたいに運やトレイナの作戦で勝つだけじゃなく、実力で勝てるようにならねーとな。</sup><br><sup>I hope I can win not only by luck or Trina's strategy but also by my ability like today.</sup></p>
<p id="L141"><br></p>
<p id="L142"><br></p>
<p id="L143">"Anyway, ......, things were awkward a while ago, are you okay now?"<br><sup>「とりあえず……さっきまで気まずい雰囲気だったけれど、もう大丈夫かい？」</sup><br><sup>"For now... it was an awkward atmosphere until a while ago, but are you okay now?"</sup></p>
<p id="L144"><br></p>
<p id="L145">「「「「. 」」」」<br><sup>「「「「ッッ！？」」」」</sup><br><sup>"'Huh!'"</sup></p>
<p id="L146"><br></p>
<p id="L147"><br></p>
<p id="L148">And then the prince, who had been silently watching us all this time, came out, folding his arms and smiling at us.<br><sup>と、これまでずっと黙って俺たちを見守っていた王子が、腕組みしながら俺たちに微笑みながら出て来た。</sup><br><sup>said the prince, who had been watching us silently, smiling at us with his arms folded.</sup></p>
<p id="L149"><br></p>
<p id="L150">"Nice, guys. It's kind of nice."<br><sup>「いいね、君たち。なんかいいよ」</sup><br><sup>"All right, boys.I don't mind."</sup></p>
<p id="L151">"What the hell, Prince ......?"<br><sup>「な、なんだよ、王子……」</sup><br><sup>"What, prince?"</sup></p>
<p id="L152">"I have men who fight with me, ...... and cute little birds who adore me, ...... but I've never had a friend or companion who could ...... bicker with me, inspire me, make me laugh, and accept me like you. But I didn't have a friend or companion to inspire me, to make me laugh, or to accept me as I am.<br><sup>「僕には一緒に戦ってくれる部下がいる……慕ってくれるカワイイ小鳥たちがいる……でも、君たちのように……いがみ合ったり、でも刺激し合ったり、笑い合ったり、そして自分を認めてくれる友や仲間が居なかったから……僕も……欲しかった」</sup><br><sup>"I have subordinates who fight with me... who adore me... but like you... we quarrel, but we stimulate each other, we laugh at each other, and we didn't have any friends or friends who recognized us... so did I."</sup></p>
<p id="L153"><br></p>
<p id="L154">The prince smiles dazzlingly, looking somewhat envious of us.<br><sup>俺たちを何だか羨ましそうに眩しそうに笑う王子。</sup><br><sup>The prince laughs at us in a kind of course.</sup></p>
<p id="L155">What is it?　I don't think it's such a big deal. ......<br><sup>なんだ？　そんな大げさに言うようなことでもないような気もするが……</sup><br><sup>What? I don't think I'm going to exaggerate that much, but...</sup></p>
<p id="L156"><br></p>
<p id="L157">"Well, the first person I want to acknowledge is from ...... my people. ......<br><sup>「まっ、僕が最初に認めて欲しい人は……身内からなんだけどね……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, the first person I want you to admit is... from your relatives..."</sup></p>
<p id="L158"><br></p>
<p id="L159">Well, ...... well, he's lived through a lot of troublesome circumstances, too. ......<br><sup>そうか……そういやこいつも色々と面倒な境遇で生きてきたんだったな……</sup><br><sup>I see... I see. No, he's lived in a lot of trouble,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.</sup></p>
<p id="L160"><br></p>
<p id="L161">"Anyway, I'm the same as you ....... This sky world itself ...... once again. I'm really sorry for what I did to the people of that country where Yamidire was.<br><sup>「とにかく僕も君らと同じ……仕切り直しだ。この天空世界そのもの……もう一度。ヤミディレが居たあの国の人たちにも本当に申し訳ないことをしてしまった」</sup><br><sup>"Anyway, I'm just like you... it's a fresh start.This heavenly world itself... once again.I'm really sorry to the people of that country where Yamidile was."</sup></p>
<p id="L162">"I'm sure you'll be able to figure out what to do. Apologies and what you're going to do about it. ......"<br><sup>「ああ、ま～そこら辺はマチョウさんたちとジックリ話し合えよ。謝罪も、これから何をどうしていくのかもな……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, well, talk to Matthews about that.I wonder what and what I'm going to do with my apology..."</sup></p>
<p id="L163">"Yeah, I'll do that."<br><sup>「ああ、そうさせてもらうよ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I will,"</sup></p>
<p id="L164"><br></p>
<p id="L165">It's not just Fiancé, Rival, and Hu.<br><sup>フィアンセイ、リヴァル、フーだけじゃない。</sup><br><sup>It's not just Fiancee, Rival, Fu.</sup></p>
<p id="L166">Like Kron earlier, the prince also seemed to have realized what he needed to do from now on after today's experience and felt that he needed to work harder, and I felt that we all came together in a refreshing way.<br><sup>さっきはクロンもそうだったように、王子もまた今日の経験でこれから自分が何をすべきかを自覚し、もっと頑張らなければならないと思うようになったようで、何だか皆爽やかにまとまった気がした。</sup><br><sup>Just as Cron did earlier, today's experience made the prince aware of what he had to do and think he had to work harder, and everyone felt refreshed and organized.</sup></p>
<p id="L167"><br></p>
<p id="L168">"Now that your people have been patched up and the Eye of Yamidire has been sealed. I hope you're okay with ...... now?"<br><sup>「さあ、君らの仲間たちの手当ても済み、ヤミディレの眼の封印も済んだ。もう……大丈夫かな？」</sup><br><sup>"Now I have taken care of your companions, and sealed the eyes of the black sheep.Now... are you all right?"</sup></p>
<p id="L169">"Oh."<br><sup>「ああ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L170"><br></p>
<p id="L171">And while Fiancé and I were talking, the other post-processing procedures seemed to have been completed.<br><sup>そして、俺とフィアンセイが話をしている間に、その他の事後処理的な手続きは終わったようだ。</sup><br><sup>And while Fiancee and I were talking, the other post-processing procedures seemed to be over.</sup></p>
<p id="L172">If that happens, there will be nothing left to do in this country.<br><sup>そうなれば、もうこの国であとやることは何もない。</sup><br><sup>If that happens, there will be nothing left to do in this country.</sup></p>
<p id="L173">To be honest, I couldn't really take the time to look around at anything in particular, even though I had arrived and stepped into a world that was even considered legendary, but I guess this country isn't in that situation now, and before it gets too much trouble, ......<br><sup>正直、せっかく伝説とまで言われている世界に辿り着いて足を踏み入れたのに、特に何かをゆっくり見て回るようなこともできなかったが、この国も今はそういう状況ではないだろうし、面倒にならないうちに……</sup><br><sup>To be honest, I couldn't take my time looking around especially when I got to the world of legend, but I don't think that's the case in this country right now, and before it gets troublesome...</sup></p>
<p id="L174"><br></p>
<p id="L175"><br></p>
<p id="L176">"Okay, let's go to .......<br><sup>「よし、んじゃあ行くか……」</sup><br><sup>"All right, then let's go..."</sup></p>
<p id="L177"><br></p>
<p id="L178"><br></p>
<p id="L179">Let's go back. Back to the surface. And me and Traina will be at the next ----<br><sup>戻ろう。地上へ。そして俺とトレイナは次の――――</sup><br><sup>Let's go back to the ground.And Trina and I are going to...</sup></p>

<p id="La1">A recent thought.<br><sup>最近思ったこと。</sup><br><sup>What I've been thinking lately.</sup></p>
<p id="La2">I've gotten a variety of opinions, and I've been in the Cron camp, the Shinob camp, the Sadis camp, the Flora camp ...... Oh, I'm sorry. Flora is no good. Flora is everyone's wife. I'm sure you'll agree with me. I love my childhood friends. But sometimes I have to make a hard decision when I have to choose. Aside from that, it's rare for a princess to receive so many names. I wonder how many more I'll get. By the way, the name I received from a reader that made me laugh was Princess Fraser0, who immediately gave me a counter. For a moment, I imagined her wearing a dress. Rumor has it that he's the root of Todoroki 0f Hiro 0ka, or something like that.<br><sup>様々な意見を戴き、クロン派、シノブ派、やっぱりサディス派、フローラ派……あっ、すんません。フローラはダメだ。フローラは皆の嫁ですね。ちなみに私は本当に幼馴染は大切にする派なので誤解なさらないでください。幼馴染好きです。たまにどうしても選択するとき苦渋の決断する時はありますが。それはさておき、ここまで多くの名前を貰える姫も珍しいですね。果たしてどれだけ増えるか。ちなみに、読者様から貰った名前でウケたのは即座にカウンターくれたフレイザー〇姫ですね。一瞬、あの金平糖がドレス着てる姿を想像してしまいました。噂では奴こそがヒロ〇カの轟〇凍のルーツだとかどうとか。</sup><br><sup>I received various opinions, Cron, Sinob, Sadis, Flora... Oh, I'm sorry.Flora can't do it.Flora is everyone's daughter-in-law.By the way, I really value my childhood friends, so don't get me wrong.I like childhood friends.Sometimes I make a painful decision when I make a choice.Apart from that, it is rare for a princess to get so many names.How much will it increase?By the way, Princess Fraser 〇, who immediately counterattacked me with the name I received from the reader, was funny.For a moment, I imagined that Kinpei sugar was wearing a dress.Rumor has it that he is the root of Hiro 〇ca's roar 〇frozen.</sup></p>
<p id="La3"><br></p>
<p id="La4">Well, at any rate, it was an aha moment for me to hear many of your thoughts on the four of us.<br><sup>まあ、とりあえず４人への皆さんの想いを色々と聞けたことで、ハッとしました。</sup><br><sup>Well, for now, I was surprised to hear about your thoughts on the four of us.</sup></p>
<p id="La5"><br></p>
<p id="La6">I see the Traina faction is gone with ....... No, it's fine, but I stupidly thought that my master, who hasn't been involved in many stories in the last few years, might be a little lonely these days.<br><sup>トレイナ派が居なくなってるな……と。いや、いいんですがここ数話あまり話に絡めてない師匠が最近少し寂しがっているのではないかなとアホなことを思った次第です。</sup><br><sup>There's no longer a Trina school...No, it's okay, but I thought it was silly that the teacher, who hasn't been involved in much of the past few episodes, might be a little lonely these days.</sup></p>
