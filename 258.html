<p id="L1">"Well, there you are, my brother. You were trying to choose a spice.

<p id="L3">"Ha, ha. ......"<br><sup>「は、はぁ……」</sup><br><sup>"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.</sup></p>

<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7"><br></p>
<p id="L8">Suddenly, the manager appeared, who seemed to be not only a real person, but also quite famous.<br><sup>急に現れた、只者では無さそうで、尚且つ結構有名そうだと思われる店長。</sup><br><sup>The manager suddenly appeared, who seemed to be not ordinary, and who seemed quite famous.</sup></p>
<p id="L9">As if to test me, he sticks out his expressionless face and asks me a question.<br><sup>俺を試すように無表情の顔を突き出して俺に問い詰めて来る。</sup><br><sup>He thrust out his expressionless face as if to test me and questioned me.</sup></p>
<p id="L10">It's as if I don't know what's really going on and I honestly don't want to get involved. ......<br><sup>まるで真意が分からず、正直関わりたくないのだが……</sup><br><sup>I don't know what you really mean, and I honestly don't want to get involved, but...</sup></p>
<p id="L11"><br></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">"Spice is a great help in the hunter family business, ...... at least more than potions. That's what I think. But the world today doesn't know it, and doesn't want to understand it.<br><sup>「スパイスというのは、ハンター家業において大いに力となるもの……少なくともポーションよりもね。ボクはそう思っている。しかし、今の世の中はそれを知っている者もいなければ、理解しようともしない」</sup><br><sup>"Spice is a great force in the hunter's business... at least more than potions.That's what I think.But in today's world, no one knows it or tries to understand it."</sup></p>

<p id="L16"><br></p>
<p id="L17">"So is this knife, okay?"<br><sup>「このナイフもそうだよ？」</sup><br><sup>"So is this knife?"</sup></p>
<p id="L18"><br></p>
<p id="L19">"...... ah ......"<br><sup>「……あ……」</sup><br><sup>"...oh..."</sup></p>
<p id="L20"><br></p>
<p id="L21"><br></p>
<p id="L22">Then the manager pulled something out of his own pants pocket.<br><sup>そう言って、店長は自身のズボンのポケットから何かを取り出した。</sup><br><sup>The manager took something out of his pants pocket.</sup></p>
<p id="L23">It was an old, slightly used, magical survival knife.<br><sup>それは、使い込まれてちょっと古くなった、マジカルサバイバルナイフだ。</sup><br><sup>It's a magical survival knife that's been used a little old.</sup></p>
<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25">"He's a ...... user or .......<br><sup>『こやつ……使用者か……』</sup><br><sup>"Koyatsu... User..."</sup></p>
<p id="L26"><br></p>
<p id="L27">Traina nodded admiringly.<br><sup>トレイナが感心したように頷いた。</sup><br><sup>Trina nodded admiringly.</sup></p>
<p id="L28">Yes, the man in front of me is using a Magical Survival Knife, which many hunters were not willing to buy despite its very low price, saying that it has a bad image.<br><sup>そう、目の前の男は、多くのハンターたちが「イメージが悪い」と言って、激安でありながら購入しようとしなかったマジカルサバイバルナイフを使用している。</sup><br><sup>Yes, the man in front of me is using a magic survival knife, which many hunters say is "bad image" and would not buy at a very low price.</sup></p>
<p id="L29">And more: ......<br><sup>さらに……</sup><br><sup>What's more...</sup></p>
<p id="L30"><br></p>
<p id="L31">"Even this one is nutritious, okay?"<br><sup>「これだって、栄養満点だよ？」</sup><br><sup>"This is nutritious, too?"</sup></p>
<p id="L32"><br></p>
<p id="L33">And now, from the opposite pocket, he pulled out a bag of Calorie Friend, peeled it off and bit straight into it.<br><sup>そして、今度は反対側のポケットから、カロリーフレンドの袋を取り出して、剥いてそのまま齧った。</sup><br><sup>This time, he took out his calorie friend's bag from the other pocket, peeled it off, and bit it.</sup></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35">"Oh, oh, ......."<br><sup>「お、おお……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, oh..."</sup></p>
<p id="L36"><br></p>
<p id="L37">I see. So this is what you're saying?<br><sup>なるほど。つまりこういうことか？</sup><br><sup>I see. Is this what you mean?</sup></p>
<p id="L38">Knives and portable food are very useful if you buy them. This man knows that, so he sells them as products.<br><sup>買えば非常に役に立つナイフや携帯食。この男もそれを知っているから商品として売っている。</sup><br><sup>Knives and portable food are very useful if you buy them.This man knows that, so he sells it as a product.</sup></p>
<p id="L39">However, hunters do not buy them because they know that they were once used by the soldiers of the Demon King's army, and they are concerned about that image.<br><sup>だけど、かつて魔王軍の兵が使用していたと知っているから、そのイメージを気にしてハンターたちは購入しない。</sup><br><sup>However, hunters don't buy it because they know it was once used by demon soldiers.</sup></p>
<p id="L40">And in the midst of all that, you're saying you're interested in me trying to buy something like that without a care in the world?<br><sup>そんな中で、そんなことも気にせずに購入しようとしている俺に興味を持ったと？</sup><br><sup>In the midst of that, you became interested in me trying to buy it without worrying about it?</sup></p>
<p id="L41">But I wouldn't have been interested in it either if Traina hadn't told me about it. ......<br><sup>でも、俺もトレイナが教えてくれなければ興味も持たなかったし……</sup><br><sup>But I wouldn't have been interested unless Trina told me...</sup></p>
<p id="L42"><br></p>
<p id="L43">"I admit it. I admit that I don't know you, but you're a man who knows me. That's why I want to know. Which spice would you choose?　What would you buy?　I want to know. I want to know. I want to know more about you.<br><sup>「ボクは認める。ボクのことは知らないのに、君は分かっている男だ。だからこそ知りたい。君ならスパイスでどれを選ぶ？　何を買う？　知りたいな。ボクは知りたい。ボクは君のことをもっと知りたいな」</sup><br><sup>"I admit it.You don't know me, but you know me.That's why I want to know.Which spice would you choose? What would you buy? I'd like to know.I want to know.I'd like to know more about you."</sup></p>
<p id="L44"><br></p>
<p id="L45">I guess he's happy that I'm buying it, he said excitedly, closing the distance even further ...... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<br><sup>俺が買うのが嬉しいのか、こいつは更に距離を詰めて興奮したように……いやいや、怖い怖い近い近い。</sup><br><sup>Maybe he's happy to buy it, but he's even closer and excited... No, it's scary. It's close.</sup></p>
<p id="L46">I mean, what the hell is this guy?　Traina?<br><sup>ってか、こいつ何なんだ？　トレイナ？</sup><br><sup>I mean, what's wrong with him, Trina?</sup></p>
<p id="L47"><br></p>
<p id="L48">"...... umm ......<br><sup>『……うーむ……』</sup><br><sup>'...um...'</sup></p>
<p id="L49">"Hey, Traina. You seemed to know this guy.<br><sup>『おい、トレイナ。あんた、こいつのこと知ってる感じだったけど？』</sup><br><sup>"Hey, Trina.You seemed to know him, didn't you?"</sup></p>

<p id="L51"><br></p>
<p id="L52">More than ten years ago. Well, that's right, I said ......, but wait a minute. How old is this guy?<br><sup>十数年前。まぁ、そりゃそうだ……と言いつつ、ちょっと待て。この男って何歳だ？</sup><br><sup>More than a decade ago. Well, that's right... Wait a minute.How old is this man?</sup></p>
<p id="L53">You're not that old, are you?　Definitely not more than 30.<br><sup>そんなに歳はいってねーよな？　絶対に三十とかはいってない。</sup><br><sup>You're that old, aren't you?I'm definitely not 30 years old.</sup></p>
<p id="L54">Late twenties?　No, early twenties?　I'd believe you if you said you were a teenager. ......<br><sup>二十代後半？　いや、前半？　十代って言われても信じるけど……</sup><br><sup>Late twenties? No, early twenties?I believe you're a teenager, but...</sup></p>
<p id="L55"><br></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">"There was once a boy, less than ten years old at the time, who made a name for himself as a dedicated hunter of monsters and bounty hunters. ......<br><sup>『かつて、モンスターや賞金首専用のハンターとして名を馳せた、当時十歳にも満たない少年がいた……』</sup><br><sup>'There used to be a boy under the age of ten who was famous as a monster and a hunter exclusively for the head of prize money...'</sup></p>

<p id="L64">Trena is staring at the manager with her arms folded as if remembering the past.<br><sup>トレイナが昔を思い出すように腕組みしながら店長をジッと見ている。</sup><br><sup>Trina looks at the manager with her arms folded to remind her of the past.</sup></p>

<p id="L75">I see. ...... It seems that you have some kind of complicated past, but for now, this guy was a great hunter who was good enough to be in Traina's ear.<br><sup>なるほど……何やら色々と複雑な過去をお持ちのようだが、とりあえずこいつは、トレイナの耳に入るぐらいの凄腕ハンターだったと。</sup><br><sup>I see... you seem to have a complicated past, but for now, he was such a talented hunter that Trina could hear.</sup></p>

<p id="L80">He's interested in me.<br><sup>俺に興味を示している。</sup><br><sup>He's interested in me.</sup></p>
<p id="L81">From the looks of this surroundings, he was probably quite famous as a hunter rather than as a manager.<br><sup>周囲のこの様子からも、店長としてというよりは、ハンターとして相当有名人だったんだろう。</sup><br><sup>Judging from the appearance around him, he must have been quite famous as a hunter rather than as a manager.</sup></p>
<p id="L82">He doesn't know himself to be such a celebrity. He doesn't know that I'm such a celebrity, and yet the tools I'm trying to choose and buy are the ones that make him go, "Oh!<br><sup>そんな有名人である自分を知らない。それでいて、ちゃんと選んで買おうとしている道具はこいつにとって「おおっ」と思うもの。</sup><br><sup>I don't know myself as such a celebrity.Still, the tools I'm trying to choose and buy are something that makes me think "oh my geez.</sup></p>
