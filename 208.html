<p id="L1">The warding of the cakretail, which had prevented any contact for the past several months, was lifted.<br><sup>結界によってこの数ヶ月間一切の連絡を取ることができなかった、カクレテールの結界が解除された。</sup><br><sup>The boundary of Kakretail, which has not been in contact with anyone for the past few months, has been lifted.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">That's where Earth might be.<br><sup>そこにアースが居るかもしれない。</sup><br><sup>There may be Earth there.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">The Yamidire might have something to do with it.<br><sup>そこに、あのヤミディレも何か関わっているかもしれない。</sup><br><sup>That yamidire may have something to do with it.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">Just the thought of it made me think of how many times I've tried to break that ward by force.<br><sup>そう思うだけで、これまで何度その結界を力ずくで破ろうかと考えた。</sup><br><sup>Just thinking about it, I thought about how many times I'd break the boundary by force.</sup></p>
<p id="L5">But I was not allowed to do so, and for the past three months, all Ma'am and I could do was pray.<br><sup>しかし、俺にそれをすることが許されず、この三か月、俺もマアムもただ祈るだけしかできなかった。</sup><br><sup>But I was not allowed to do it, and for the past three months both I and Maam could only pray.</sup></p>
<p id="L6">But those days are finally over at ......<br><sup>だが、その日々がようやく……</sup><br><sup>But those days are finally...</sup></p>
<p id="L7"><br></p>
<p id="L8"><br></p>
<p id="L9">As I said before, in order to contact Kakreter, you must negotiate your entry through the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Betrayal. There are restrictions on the purpose of the trip, the number of people entering the country, the size of the ship docked, the amount of time you may stay in the country, as well as restrictions on weapons and magic.<br><sup>『以前にも申し上げた通り、カクレテールと連絡を取るには『ベトレイアル王国』の外務大臣を通じて、入国交渉をしなければなりません。審査にあたり、渡航目的、入国の人数、停泊する船の大きさ、国内へ持ち込むものに関する事前申請、滞在期間、更には武器や魔法の制限もあります』</sup><br><sup>'As I said before, in order to communicate with Cacletair, you must negotiate entry through the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Betrair.There are also travel objectives, number of people entering the country, size of the ship to be anchored, pre-application for items to be brought into the country, length of stay, and restrictions on weapons and magic."</sup></p>
<p id="L10"><br></p>
<p id="L11">"Rumor has it that the civil war has been intense in recent years, and that there may be some very strict requirements for entry. Along with that, you'll have to pay an entry fee to Cakretail, as well as an intermediary fee to the Kingdom of Betrayal.<br><sup>『噂では近年内戦が激しいとのことで、入国審査にはかなり厳しい条件が与えられるかもしれないとのこと。それに伴い、カクレテールへの入国料、さらにはベトレイアル王国への仲介料も必要となります』</sup><br><sup>"Rumor has it that civil war has been raging in recent years, and immigration may be subject to very strict conditions.There will also be a fee for entry into Cacletair, and an intermediary fee for the Kingdom of Betrair."</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">In addition, if you want to go to Kakretere by sea, you must notify the naval admiral of the Kingdom of Zenigeva, which claims that area of the sea as its territorial waters.<br><sup>『さらに、カクレテールへ海上ルートで行く場合には、あの一帯の海を領海として主張する『ゼニゲーヴァ王国』の海軍提督への通達』</sup><br><sup>"Furthermore, if you go to Cacletair by sea, you will be notified to the admiral of the Kingdom of Zenigeva, which claims that the sea in that area is your territorial sea."</sup></p>
<p id="L14"><br></p>
<p id="L15">"Oh my god, Hiiro-sama!　I'm not sure what to make of this, but I think it's a good idea. ...Something may have happened!<br><sup>『大変です、ヒイロ様！　結界が解けた直後にベトレイアル王国がカクレテールに入国の申請をしたところ、反体制側が勝利したことで窓口が変わったようで、さらに現在その新たな窓口へ連絡を取ろうとしているようですが、一向に連絡が繋がらないとのことで……何かあったのかもしれません！』</sup><br><sup>'Oh, Hiro! Immediately after the boundary was lifted, the Kingdom of Vetrair applied to enter Cacletair, and the counterpart seems to have changed due to the victory of the dissidents, and they seem to be trying to contact the new counter.</sup></p>
<p id="L16"><br></p>
<p id="L17"><br></p>
<p id="L18">We couldn't just ignore the procedure and fly away when our "beloved son might be there.<br><sup>俺たちは「愛する息子がそこに居るかもしれない」のに、手続きを無視して飛んでいくことができなかった。</sup><br><sup>We couldn't fly away ignoring the procedures even though our beloved son might be there.</sup></p>
<p id="L19"><br></p>
<p id="L20">You can't enter Kakreter!<br><sup>『カクレテール入国できません！』</sup><br><sup>'You can't enter Kakretail!'</sup></p>
<p id="L21"><br></p>
<p id="L22">At the sound of his voice, I hung my head and sobbed.<br><sup>その声に、俺は頭を抱えて項垂れちまった。</sup><br><sup>I drooped with my head in my arms at that voice.</sup></p>
<p id="L23">Kakretele, a closed country that has been completely unreachable for three months now.<br><sup>三か月前から一切連絡が取れなくなった鎖国国家カクレテール。</sup><br><sup>Kakretail, a closed country that has been out of touch for three months.</sup></p>
<p id="L24">However, it is strictly forbidden for the Empire, which is also a member of the Federation, to interfere with or land on Kakreterre without permission.<br><sup>しかし、連合加盟国でもある帝国が無断でカクレテールへ干渉及び上陸は固く禁止されている。</sup><br><sup>However, the empire, which is also a member of the Allied Powers, is strictly prohibited from interfering and landing in Cacletair without permission.</sup></p>
<p id="L25">Because of this, there was nothing they could do, but just the other day, the warding was finally lifted.<br><sup>そのためどうすることもできなかったが、つい先日になってようやく結界が解かれたとのこと。</sup><br><sup>So there was nothing he could do about it, but it was only a few days ago that the boundary was resolved.</sup></p>
<p id="L26">I had been preparing for the application process for three months, and I thought it would be a quick process, but as it turned out, that wasn't going to happen any time soon either.<br><sup>申請手続きの準備は三か月前からしていたから、すぐに話は通ると思っていたのに、結局それもすぐに叶いそうにない。</sup><br><sup>I've been preparing for the application process for three months, so I thought it would work out soon, but it doesn't seem like it will come true soon.</sup></p>
<p id="L27">And more: ......<br><sup>さらに……</sup><br><sup>What's more...</sup></p>
<p id="L28"><br></p>
<p id="L29">'Master Hiiro, we are in trouble!　The princess you brought back to the Imperial Capital, ...... Rival, ...... Fu, ...... and the daughter of the Pipa family, the ninja warrior of Giapone... ...five ninja warriors have disappeared. Reportedly, in Fu Meedai's room, there was a spatial travel magic formula ...... that perhaps he had mastered in the past three months. ......<br><sup>『ヒイロ様、大変です！　帝都に連れ戻した姫様……リヴァル……フー……そしてパイパ家の娘、ジャポーネの忍者戦士……五人の姿が消えたそうです。報告ではフー・ミーダイの部屋に、空間移動魔法の術式が……ひょっとしたらこの三か月の間に習得したのかもしれないと……』</sup><br><sup>'Hiro-sama, I'm in trouble!The princess who brought her back to the imperial capital... Rival... Who... and the ninja warriors of the Pipa family's daughter, Japone... they disappeared.According to the report, in Fu Meidai's room, the magic of space movement... maybe I've learned it in the last three months..."</sup></p>
<p id="L30"><br></p>
<p id="L31">While we adults were lingering around, the next generation seemed to have bypassed the hassle and moved on.<br><sup>俺ら大人たちがダラダラグズグズしている間に、次の世代の奴らがメンドクセエもんをすっとばして動いたようだ。</sup><br><sup>It seems that the next generation of us moved quickly through the Mendokseye gate while we adults were dawdling.</sup></p>
<p id="L32">I was so dazzled by it that I felt ashamed of myself. ......<br><sup>それが眩しくて、自分が情けなくて……</sup><br><sup>It's so bright that I feel sorry for myself...</sup></p>
<p id="L33"><br></p>
<p id="L34">"That's why ...... is the only way to go.<br><sup>「つーわけで……これしかねーよな」</sup><br><sup>"That's all... that's all,"</sup></p>
<p id="L35">"Really. It's been a while since our last date. On the ocean, on a boat, making out."<br><sup>「ほんと。久々のデート。海の上、ボートでイチャイチャ」</sup><br><sup>"Really. It's been a long time since we had a date.It's a boat ride on the sea."</sup></p>
<p id="L36">"Then I drifted away and got lost. Oh, my God."<br><sup>「そしたら漂流しちまって遭難。なんてこった」</sup><br><sup>"Then he drifted away and was in distress.Oh, my God."</sup></p>
<p id="L37">"Oh my God, I can see the island over there!　Did we make it?"<br><sup>「あら、あそこに島が見えるわ！　私たち、助かったの？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, I see an island over there! Were we saved?"</sup></p>
<p id="L38">"Oh, yeah. Thank God. Let's go for now."<br><sup>「おお、そうだ。助かった。とりあえず行ってみよう」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, yes.That's a relief. Let's go for now."</sup></p>
<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">If the wards have been lifted, this is all we have left.<br><sup>結界が解かれているのなら、もうこれしかない。</sup><br><sup>If the boundary has been resolved, this is the only way.</sup></p>
<p id="L41">I'm going to pretend that Ma'am and I arrived by accident, like castaways, by rowing a small boat away from Kakuretail.<br><sup>俺とマアムはカクレテールから離れた個所から小舟を漕いで、漂流者っぽく偶然たどり着いたということにする。</sup><br><sup>Maam and I rowed a boat from a distance from Cacletail and arrived by accident like a drifter.</sup></p>
<p id="L42">Of course, this is a secret from the Coalition, Mikado Zee, and the Imperial City.<br><sup>もちろん、これは連合やミカドのジーさんや帝都にも内緒だ。</sup><br><sup>Of course, this is a secret from Rengo, Mikado's Zee and the Imperial Capital.</sup></p>
<p id="L43">We're responsible, of course. Well, if anything happens to you, you'll be fired. ......<br><sup>責任は当然俺たち。まあ、もし何かあればクビだろうけどな……</sup><br><sup>Of course we're responsible.Well, if anything should happen, I'd be fired...</sup></p>
<p id="L44"><br></p>
<p id="L45">"When I was a ...... kid, I was annoyed by the rules set by the ...... adults, and I always lost my temper and broke them. I was always getting angry and breaking those rules.<br><sup>「はぁ……ガキの頃は……大人たちが決めて縛ったルールがうざったくて、いつもキレてそういうのぶっ壊して……そのたびにミカドのジーさんに怒られたっけな」</sup><br><sup>"Oh... when I was a kid... the rules that adults decided to tie were annoying, so I always got angry and broke them... I wonder if Mikado's Zee scolded me every time."</sup></p>
<p id="L46">"Yeah, I know. At the time, I thought I could do anything if I just grew up quickly and became elated. ......"<br><sup>「そうね。あのときは、さっさと大人になってエラくなれば何でもできるって思ったのにね……」</sup><br><sup>"Yes. At that time, I thought I could do anything if I grew up quickly and got an error..."</sup></p>
<p id="L47">"Oh. I can't do anything better now. ...... I don't know what I'm doing. ...... I really don't."<br><sup>「ああ。今の方が何もできなくなっちまった……何やってんだろうな……本当に」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, I can't do anything now... I wonder what you're doing... really."</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">As we rowed the small boat, I lamented our pettiness with Ma'am.<br><sup>小舟を漕ぎながら、マアムと一緒に自分たちの情けなさを嘆く。</sup><br><sup>They rowed a boat and lamented their pity with Maam.</sup></p>
<p id="L50">It took me this long just to get to my son who was missing.<br><sup>行方不明になった自分の息子の元へ行くだけで、こんなに時間がかかっちまった。</sup><br><sup>It took me so long just to go to my missing son.</sup></p>
<p id="L51"><br></p>
<p id="L52">"It's all my fault.<br><sup>「全部俺の所為だ」</sup><br><sup>"It's all my fault,"</sup></p>
<p id="L53">"No. It's my fault."<br><sup>「いいえ。私の所為よ」</sup><br><sup>"No, it's my fault,"</sup></p>
<p id="L54">"No, it's my fault!　I've been neglecting him all this time. ......"<br><sup>「いいや、俺の所為だ！　これまでずっとあいつをほったらかしにして……」</sup><br><sup>"No, it's my fault!"I've been leaving him alone..."</sup></p>
<p id="L55">"It's the same for me!　In the first place, I should have quit my ...... job as soon as possible and become a mother. ...... I put everything on Sadis. ......"<br><sup>「それは私も同じよ！　そもそも……私なんてさっさと仕事をやめちゃって、母親やってりゃよかったのよ……全部サディスに押し付けて……」</sup><br><sup>"That's the same for me!"In the first place... I should have quit my job quickly and done my mother's job... and forced everything on Sadis..."</sup></p>
<p id="L56">"You weren't in a position to quit so easily. I had no choice. So it's still my father's fault.<br><sup>「お前も簡単にやめられる立場じゃなかった。仕方ねえよ。だから、やっぱり親父の俺の責任だ」</sup><br><sup>"You weren't in a position to quit easily.I can't help it. That's why it's my father's fault."</sup></p>
<p id="L57"><br></p>
<p id="L58">I can't tell you how many times we've had this exchange in the past three months.<br><sup>この三か月、何度このやりとりをしたか。</sup><br><sup>How many times have you had this conversation in the past three months?</sup></p>
<p id="L59">They keep blaming themselves for each other, which makes no sense whatsoever.<br><sup>互いに自分自身を責めることで、何の意味もないことを繰り返してる。</sup><br><sup>We're repeating meaningless things by blaming each other for ourselves.</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">"But it's still me. If only I had ...... caught that guy at Kanteidan!　And if only I had noticed Yamidire approaching!"<br><sup>「でも、やっぱり私よ。私が……私がカンティーダンであいつを捕まえていれば！　ヤミディレの接近にも気づいていれば！」</sup><br><sup>"But it's me, after all.If I... had caught him in Kantidan!If you notice the approach of the yamidire!"</sup></p>
<p id="L62">"It's such a ............ well, ...... thing."<br><sup>「そんなこ…………まぁ……それは」</sup><br><sup>"That's......well......that's it."</sup></p>
<p id="L63">"What about ......?"<br><sup>「……はぁ？」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L64">"No, I didn't notice until the last minute that such a crazy woman with a full of evil air was approaching ......."<br><sup>「いや、あんな禍々しい空気満載の狂気の塊みてーな女が接近してんのにギリギリまで気づかなかったのは……」</sup><br><sup>"No, I didn't notice until the very last minute that such a wicked, air-filled madness was approaching..."</sup></p>
<p id="L65">"Wait!　If you're saying that, then you're the one who went out of the Imperial Capital saying, "I'll find Earth! I'm sure you'll be able to find it," he said, "but why are you leaving the Imperial City and going to Inerui City, which is in a completely different direction?<br><sup>「ちょ！？　そ、それを言うならあんたは息巻いて、『俺がアースを必ず見つける！』なんて言って帝都から出て行って、何で全然方角の違うイナーイ都市なんかに行ってんのよ！」</sup><br><sup>"Hey!? Well, if you're going to say that, you're going to gasp and say, 'I'll definitely find Earth!' and leave the imperial capital, and why are you going to Inani City in a completely different direction?"</sup></p>
<p id="L66">"Ugh, ...... that's ......."<br><sup>「うぐっ……それは……」</sup><br><sup>"Ugh... that's..."</sup></p>
<p id="L67"><br></p>
<p id="L68">Well, I mean, no matter how many times we talked over the past three months, all we could say was that we were both helpless idiots and unfit parents.<br><sup>まあ、つまりこの三か月何度話をしても、俺たちは互いにどうしようもねえバカで親失格ってことぐらいだった。</sup><br><sup>Well, I mean, no matter how many times we've talked for the past three months, we've been idiots and disqualified parents.</sup></p>
<p id="L69">It was too much to recover from.<br><sup>もう挽回なんてできないほどに。</sup><br><sup>I can't make up for it anymore.</sup></p>
<p id="L70">But so nothing more to do?　Give up?<br><sup>でも、だから何ももうしない？　諦める？</sup><br><sup>But why don't you do anything anymore?Do you want to give up?</sup></p>
<p id="L71">I just couldn't do that.<br><sup>それだけはできなかった。</sup><br><sup>That's all I couldn't do.</sup></p>
<p id="L72">Even if Earth doesn't recognize us as parents anymore: ......<br><sup>たとえ、アースがもう俺たちを親だと認めてくれなくても……</sup><br><sup>Even if Earth doesn't recognize us as parents anymore...</sup></p>
<p id="L73"><br></p>
<p id="L74">"We arrived at ....... So this is Kakuretaire."<br><sup>「っと……到着。ここがカクレテールか」</sup><br><sup>"Well... we're here.Is this Kakretail?"</sup></p>
<p id="L75">"Yeah.<br><sup>「ええ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">With these thoughts in mind, Ma'am and I finally reached the shoreline of Kakretele.<br><sup>そんな想いを抱きながら、俺とマアムはようやくカクレテールの海岸線にたどり着いた。</sup><br><sup>With that in mind, Maam and I finally reached the coastline of Kakretail.</sup></p>
<p id="L78">I've been to many countries, but this is the first place I've landed.<br><sup>これまで色々な国に行ったが、ここは初めて上陸した地。</sup><br><sup>I've been to many countries, but this is the first place to land.</sup></p>
<p id="L79">There are no particular buildings or people on the beach, but the first thing I noticed was ......<br><sup>海岸には特に建物があるわけでも、人の姿があるわけでもないが、まず気になったのは……</sup><br><sup>There are no particular buildings or figures on the beach, but the first thing that bothered me was...</sup></p>
<p id="L80"><br></p>
<p id="L81">"That's pretty rough.<br><sup>「随分と荒れてるな」</sup><br><sup>"It's very rough,"</sup></p>
<p id="L82">"Yeah. It looks like something was fought ...... and destroyed."<br><sup>「ええ。何か戦ったような……破壊されたような痕ね」</sup><br><sup>"Yes. It's like a fight... a destroyed mark."</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">Ravaged coastline and vegetation. It wasn't always like that, but it was clearly destroyed by someone's hand, and there were huge holes everywhere.<br><sup>荒れ果てた海岸線や植物。もともとそういう感じだったわけじゃなく、明らかに誰かの手によって壊され、荒れて、至る所にデカい穴も開いている。</sup><br><sup>Desolate coastlines and plants.It wasn't like that originally, but it was obviously broken by someone's hand, rough, and there are big holes everywhere.</sup></p>
<p id="L85">It was as if there had been a fierce battle. ......<br><sup>激しい戦闘でもあったかのような……</sup><br><sup>It seems that it was a fierce battle...</sup></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">"You've got some residual magic. And it's pretty big."<br><sup>「魔力の残留があるな。それに、結構大きめの」</sup><br><sup>"There's still magic left.and quite large."</sup></p>
<p id="L88">"Maybe there's a living quarters over here. ......<br><sup>「多分この向こうに居住区があるんだろうけど……」</sup><br><sup>"There's probably a residential area beyond here..."</sup></p>
<p id="L89">What's going on?"　For now, it doesn't feel like we're ...... fighting right now, but ......"<br><sup>「どうなってるかな？　とりあえず、今は……戦っているようには感じないが……」</sup><br><sup>"What's going on?"For now... I don't feel like I'm fighting, but..."</sup></p>
<p id="L90">"And ......."<br><sup>「それと……」</sup><br><sup>"And..."</sup></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">We had heard that there had been a civil war for a while and that it had recently ended, but it seemed certain that something had happened in the past few days as well.<br><sup>しばらくは内戦があり、それは最近になって終わったという情報はあったが、この数日も何かあったのは間違いなさそうだ。</sup><br><sup>There has been a civil war for a while, and there has been information that it has only recently ended, but there is no doubt that something has happened in the past few days.</sup></p>
<p id="L93">And ......<br><sup>それと……</sup><br><sup>And...</sup></p>
<p id="L94"><br></p>
<p id="L95">"That's a lot of people.<br><sup>「結構いるな」</sup><br><sup>"Quite a few,"</sup></p>
<p id="L96">"Yeah. Right. ......"<br><sup>「うん。そうね……」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, that's right..."</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">They were looking at us, looking at us, looking at us. They may not be very powerful, but they are clearly wary of us.<br><sup>こっちを伺うような視線や人の気配。力は大したことないかもしれないが、明らかに俺たちを警戒している。</sup><br><sup>A look and a sign of people looking this way.The power may not be much, but it is clear that they are wary of us.</sup></p>
<p id="L99">Well, from their point of view, they might be intruders, and rightly so.<br><sup>まあ、向こうからすれば侵入者かもしれないし、当然だろうな。</sup><br><sup>Well, it might be an intruder from their point of view, and it's only natural.</sup></p>
<p id="L100">Well, ...... managed to pose as a harmless drifter and get the information to ......<br><sup>さて……何とか無害な漂流者を装って情報を……</sup><br><sup>Now... somehow I'll pretend to be a harmless drifter and give you information...</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">"Who are you people?　What are you doing in this country!"<br><sup>「あなたたちは、何者ですか？　この国に何しに来たんですか！」</sup><br><sup>"Who are you? What are you doing here?"</sup></p>
<p id="L103"><br></p>
<p id="L104">But before we could say anything else, the people who had been hiding revealed themselves.<br><sup>だが、俺らが何かを言う前に、隠れていた連中が姿を現した。</sup><br><sup>But before we could say anything, the people who had been hiding appeared.</sup></p>
<p id="L105">Dozens of people showed up, young and old, some women who looked like sisters.<br><sup>ゾロゾロと何十人も現れて、若者から年寄りに、シスターと思われる女たちも居る。</sup><br><sup>Dozens of women appeared, from young people to old people, and there were women who were thought to be sisters.</sup></p>
<p id="L106">They all turned on us like they were using brooms, axes, knives, and other everyday items as weapons.<br><sup>全員が、箒やら斧やら包丁やら、日用品を武器にする感じで俺たちに敵意を向けている。</sup><br><sup>Everyone is hostile to us with brooms, axes, knives, and daily necessities as weapons.</sup></p>
<p id="L107">But none of them feel like warriors or soldiers of this country, they are civilians.<br><sup>しかし、誰もがこの国の戦士や軍人って感じじゃなく、民間人だ。</sup><br><sup>But not everyone feels like a soldier or a soldier in this country, but a civilian.</sup></p>
<p id="L108"><br></p>
<p id="L109">"This country will not tolerate unauthorized entry from the outside!"<br><sup>「この国は、外部から無断で入国することは許しません！」</sup><br><sup>"This country does not allow entry without permission from outside!"</sup></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111">And as if to represent them, one man tells us. Are you still a kid?　What's your age, Earth?<br><sup>そして、そんな連中を代表するように一人の男が俺たちに告げる。まだ子供？　年齢はアースぐらいか？</sup><br><sup>And a man tells us to represent them.Are you still a child?Are you about the age of Earth?</sup></p>
<p id="L112"><br></p>
<p id="L113">"Hey!　If you attack this country, I'll show you no mercy!"<br><sup>「オラァ！　もしこの国に攻めてきたってんなら容赦しねーぞ！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my God! If you've attacked this country, I won't forgive you!"</sup></p>
<p id="L114">"This country is ours to protect, isn't it?<br><sup>「こ、この国は、ぼぼ、僕たちが守るんだな！」</sup><br><sup>`We'll protect this country, Bobo!'</sup></p>
<p id="L115">"Ugh, please don't let him be dangerous. ......"<br><sup>「うぅ、どうか危ない人ではありませんように……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I hope you're not a dangerous person..."</sup></p>
<p id="L116"><br></p>

<p id="L119">"Hey, hey, ...... Mr. Motleyage, ...... those guys don't seem like bad people, but ...... what do you think?"<br><sup>「ね、ねえ……モトリアージュ君……あの人たち、悪い人たちには見えないけど……どうなのかな？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, hey... Motriage... they don't look bad, but... what do you think?"</sup></p>
<p id="L120">I don't know," he said. But now that the High Priestesses and Goddesses are gone,...... and the country is in such a situation,...... we can't let people from outside in without permission."<br><sup>「分からないよ。でも、大神官様や女神様たちが居ない今……それに国がこんな状況で……外の人たちを勝手に入れるわけにはいかない」</sup><br><sup>"I don't know, but now that there are no great priests and goddesses... and the country is in this situation... I can't let people in without permission."</sup></p>
<p id="L121"><br></p>
<p id="L122">In case you're wondering, neither Ma'am nor I carry our weapons in plain sight. We do have them ready to go at any time, though.<br><sup>一応、俺もマアムも武器は目に見えるように携帯はしてない。いつでも取り出せるようにはしてるけどな。</sup><br><sup>Just in case, neither I nor Maam carry weapons visibly.I try to take it out anytime.</sup></p>
<p id="L123">So, for the time being, we are not showing any signs of pirates or some other country attacking us, and the people around us seem to be a little confused.<br><sup>だから、そんな俺たちがとりあえずは海賊やらどこかの国が攻めてきたとかそんな雰囲気は出していないので、俺たちを取り囲む連中も少し戸惑いは生じている様子。</sup><br><sup>That's why we don't have such an atmosphere as pirates or any country has attacked us, so the people around us seem to be a little confused.</sup></p>
<p id="L124">The sisters and old people are consulting with the young people, looking a little troubled.<br><sup>シスターや年寄りたちが少し困ったように若者たちに相談している。</sup><br><sup>Sisters and old people are talking to young people in a little trouble.</sup></p>
<p id="L125">Then ......<br><sup>すると……</sup><br><sup>Then...</sup></p>
<p id="L126"><br></p>
<p id="L127">"Hey!　You don't know if it's the enemy or not, do you?　Maybe they're just trying to catch us off guard!　In any case, those angels also messed up our country with that kind of attitude!　We can't let something like that happen again!<br><sup>「オラァ！　敵かどうかなんて分からねーだろ？　ひょっとしたら油断させるためかもしれねえ！　大体、あの天使たちだってあんなツラして俺らの国をメチャクチャにしたんだ！　もう二度と、あんなことを起こすわけにはいかねーだろ！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh!

<p id="L129">And although the bossy brother shouts wildly, what he says is quite righteous.<br><sup>そして威勢のいい兄ちゃんが乱暴に声を荒げるが、言ってることはなかなか正義感溢れている。</sup><br><sup>And my energetic brother raises his voice violently, but what he is saying is quite righteous.</sup></p>
<p id="L130">I knew something was wrong. What does this have to do with the fact that the wards have been lifted?<br><sup>やっぱ何かあったようだな。結界が解かれているのもそれと何か関係が？</sup><br><sup>Something seems to have happened after all.What's the connection to that?</sup></p>
<p id="L131">But still, the angel ......<br><sup>それにしても、天使……</sup><br><sup>Even so, angels...</sup></p>
<p id="L132"><br></p>
<p id="L133">"We can't let anyone in, at least not now!　I made a promise to Earth!　He told us he'd be in charge while he was gone!　So while he's out, we'll protect this country!"<br><sup>「少なくとも、今は誰も入れるわけにはいかねえ！　アースと約束したんだ！　あいつが留守の間は任せるって俺らに言ったんだ！　だからあいつらが出ている間は、この国は俺らが守るんだ！」</sup><br><sup>"At least you can't let anyone in now!I promised Earth!He told us he'd leave it to us while he's away!So we'll protect this country while they're out!"</sup></p>

<p id="L140">For a moment I thought I heard wrong, but I was sure.<br><sup>一瞬聞き間違いかとも思ったが、間違いない。</sup><br><sup>I thought I heard it wrong for a moment, but I'm sure.</sup></p>
<p id="L141">He just said, "Earth."<br><sup>あいつは今、「アース」って言った。</sup><br><sup>He just said "Earth."</sup></p>
<p id="L142"><br></p>
<p id="L143">"Hey, hey, you!<br><sup>「ちょちょ、おい、お前！」</sup><br><sup>"Wait, hey, you!"</sup></p>

<p id="L147"><br></p>
<p id="L148">At that moment, not only the brawny guy, but also the other guys and the sister-like women have surprised looks on their faces.<br><sup>その瞬間、威勢のいい奴だけでなく、他の男たちやシスター風の女たちまで驚いた顔を浮かべている。</sup><br><sup>At that moment, not only the powerful, but also the other men and Sister-like women looked surprised.</sup></p>
<p id="L149">And your friends?<br><sup>しかもダチ？</sup><br><sup>What's more?</sup></p>
<p id="L150"><br></p>
<p id="L151">"Ma'am!"<br><sup>「マアム！」</sup><br><sup>"Maam!"</sup></p>
<p id="L152">"Yes!　I knew ...... was right, Earth is here!"<br><sup>「うん！　やっぱり……やっぱり、アースがここに！」</sup><br><sup>"Yeah! As expected... Earth is here!"</sup></p>
<p id="L153"><br></p>
<p id="L154">I was sure of it. Earth is in this country.<br><sup>やはり間違いなかった。アースがこの国に居る。</sup><br><sup>There was no doubt about it.Earth is in this country.</sup></p>
<p id="L155">I was so happy about that, I was about to cry, and that's how Ma'am and I shouted.<br><sup>それが嬉しくて、涙が出そうで、そんな気持ちを込めて俺とマアムは叫んだ。</sup><br><sup>I was so happy that I almost cried, and Maam and I shouted with such a feeling.</sup></p>
<p id="L156"><br></p>
<p id="L157">"I am Heero Ragan!　I am the father of Earth!"<br><sup>「俺はヒイロ・ラガン！　アースの父親だ！」</sup><br><sup>"I'm Hiro Lagan! I'm Earth's father!"</sup></p>

<p id="L159"><br></p>
<p id="L160">Do we deserve that?　But I had to shout it.<br><sup>俺たちにそんな資格はあるのか？　でも、そう叫ぶしかなかった。</sup><br><sup>Are we qualified for that?But I had no choice but to shout so.</sup></p>
<p id="L161"><br></p>
<p id="L162">「「「「????? 」」」」<br><sup>「「「「ッッッ！！？？」」」」</sup><br><sup>"'Huh!!?'"</sup></p>
<p id="L163"><br></p>
<p id="L164">Even if Earth doesn't recognize us: ......<br><sup>たとえ、アースが俺たちを認めなかったとしても……</sup><br><sup>Even if Earth doesn't recognize us...</sup></p>
<p id="L165"><br></p>
<p id="L166"><br></p>

<p id="L170"><br></p>
<p id="L171"><br></p>
<p id="L172">But I didn't think that even the people I'd never met before would recognize me.<br><sup>だけど、まさか初対面の連中にまで認められないとは思わなかった。</sup><br><sup>But I didn't think it would be recognized even by the people I met for the first time.</sup></p>
<p id="L173">They looked astonished at our words and shouted that and immediately ......<br><sup>俺らの言葉に驚愕した表情を浮かべた連中は、そう叫んですぐに……</sup><br><sup>Those who looked surprised at our words screamed and immediately...</sup></p>
<p id="L174"><br></p>
<p id="L175">"What's with Earth's father and mother?　They're the same age as us!"<br><sup>「何がアースの父と母だ！　あいつは俺らと同じ歳だぞ！」</sup><br><sup>"What's Earth's father and mother?"He's the same age as us!"</sup></p>
<p id="L176">"If they were, my parents wouldn't be so young!"<br><sup>「だったら親があんなに若いわけねえ！」</sup><br><sup>`Then my parents are not so young!'</sup></p>
<p id="L177">"Earth, your parents?　I'm not sure about the guy, but ......?"<br><sup>「アース君の親？　男の人はまだしも……ねえ？」</sup><br><sup>"Earth's parents?"A man is still... you know?"</sup></p>
<p id="L178">"I mean, isn't that girl ...... younger than us?<br><sup>「っていうか、あの女の子……私たちよりも年下じゃないの？」</sup><br><sup>"I mean, isn't she... younger than us?"</sup></p>
<p id="L179">"Yes, yes, yes!　It's still more understandable if you just say you're Earth's sister normally!"<br><sup>「そうだそうだ！　普通にアースの妹って言った方がまだ分かるぞ！」</sup><br><sup>"That's right! You'd better say Earth's sister normally!"</sup></p>
<p id="L180">"Don't be fooled by such an obvious lie!"<br><sup>「そんな分かりやすい嘘に騙されるか！」</sup><br><sup>"You'll be fooled by such an easy lie!"</sup></p>
<p id="L181"><br></p>
<p id="L182">At that moment, Ma'am and I both giggled in dismay.<br><sup>その瞬間、俺もマアムも呆気に取られて苦笑しちまった。</sup><br><sup>At that moment, both Maam and I laughed bitterly.</sup></p>
<p id="L183">Because there was no one in Teito who didn't know about us as a father and son, and no one had ever said to me that we didn't look like a father and son.<br><sup>だって、帝都では俺ら親子のことを知らない奴らは居ないから、「容姿が親子に見えない」なんて言われたことがなかった。</sup><br><sup>Because there are no people in the imperial capital who don't know about us parents and children, so they've never been told that we don't look like parents and children.</sup></p>
<p id="L184"><br></p>
<p id="L185">"Oh my, ...... hahaha, wow, do I still look that young?　Well, I'm an eternal teenager, aren't I?"<br><sup>「あら……あははは、わ、私ってまだまだそんなに若く見えるのかしら？　まぁ、永遠の十代だし？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh... haha, wow, do I still look so young?Well, I'm an eternal teenager?"</sup></p>
<p id="L186">"Well, ...... breasts haven't changed in over a decade. ......"<br><sup>「まぁ……胸は十年以上変化ねーからな……」</sup><br><sup>"Well... my chest hasn't changed for more than ten years..."</sup></p>
<p id="L187">"Oh no!　Wait, I swelled up a little when I gave birth to Earth!"<br><sup>「んな！？　ちょ、アースを産んだときは少しは膨らんだのよ！」</sup><br><sup>"What!? Hey, when I gave birth to Earth, it bulged a little!"</sup></p>
<p id="L188">"But it would have deflated quickly. ...... Well, Earth was always crying about it when she was a baby. ...... And the size of her breasts was overtaken by Sadis when she was about ten. ---"<br><sup>「でも、すぐ萎んだだろうが……そういや、アースが赤ん坊のころにはいつもそれで泣かれて……そういや胸の大きさも、サディスが十歳ぐらいの頃には抜かれ―――」</sup><br><sup>"But it would have withered soon... well, when Earth was a baby, she always cried about it... well, when Sadis was about ten years old, the size of her chest was pulled out????????"</sup></p>
<p id="L189">"You're annoying, you idiot!"<br><sup>「うっさいわこのバカッ！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my God!"</sup></p>
<p id="L190"><br></p>
<p id="L191">Anyway, it took me a while to get them to believe me and Ma'am.<br><sup>とにかく、俺とマアムのことを信じてもらうのに、ちょっと時間がかかった。</sup><br><sup>Anyway, it took some time for you to believe me and Maam.</sup></p>
