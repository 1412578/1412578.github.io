<p id="L1">Accompanied by Eira, Kazuyoshi and Baretta came to a room prepared for them on the fourth floor.<br><sup>エイラに連れられて、一良とバレッタは４階に用意された部屋にやってきた。</sup><br><sup>Ayla took him to a room on the fourth floor.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">I brought a change of clothes, daily necessities, and other belongings into my room, but left everything else on the wagon in the square.<br><sup>着替えや日用品などの荷物は部屋に運び込んだが、他のものは広場の荷馬車に置きっぱなしだ。</sup><br><sup>He carried his clothes and daily necessities into his room, but left the rest in the cart in the square.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">The luggage will be brought into a separate room on the first floor tomorrow morning.<br><sup>それらの荷物は、明日の朝に１階の別室に運び込む予定である。</sup><br><sup>The luggage will be carried into a separate room on the ground floor tomorrow morning.</sup></p>
<p id="L4"><br></p>
<p id="L5">"Lady Kazura, how would you like to be served?"<br><sup>「カズラ様、給仕はいかがいたしますか？」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Kazura, how would you like to serve?"</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">"Oh, I'll take care of it on my own. I'll call you if I need anything."<br><sup>「あ、勝手にやるんで大丈夫です。何かあったら呼びますんで」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, I'll do whatever I want, so it's all right.I'll call you if anything happens."</sup></p>
<p id="L8"><br></p>
<p id="L9">"Yes, sir."<br><sup>「かしこまりました」</sup><br><sup>"Very well,"</sup></p>
<p id="L10"><br></p>
<p id="L11">Eira opens the door and Valletta enters the room first.<br><sup>エイラが扉を開け、先にバレッタが部屋に入る。</sup><br><sup>Ayla opens the door and Valletta enters the room first.</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">"That ......."<br><sup>「あの……」</sup><br><sup>"Well..."</sup></p>
<p id="L14"><br></p>
<p id="L15">Kazuyoshi was about to enter the room when Eira called out to him.<br><sup>続いて一良も部屋に入ろうとすると、エイラに声をかけられた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira tried to enter the room, Aira called out to him.</sup></p>
<p id="L16"><br></p>
<p id="L17">"Hmm, what's wrong?"<br><sup>「ん、どうしました？」</sup><br><sup>"What's the matter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L18"><br></p>
<p id="L19">"...... No, it's nothing. My apologies."<br><sup>「……いえ、何でもありません。失礼いたしました」</sup><br><sup>"...no, it's nothing.I beg your pardon me.</sup></p>
<p id="L20"><br></p>
<p id="L21">While tilting my head at Eira's unfamiliar attitude, I enter the room.<br><sup>よく分からない態度を取るエイラに小首を傾げながらも、部屋に入る。</sup><br><sup>He went into the room with his head tilted slightly at Ayla, who was not sure.</sup></p>
<p id="L22">As I closed the door and looked up, my eyes met with Baretta's, who had entered earlier.<br><sup>扉を閉めて顔を上げると、先に入っていたバレッタと目が合った。</sup><br><sup>When I closed the door and looked up, I met Valletta, who was in front of me.</sup></p>
<p id="L23">Somehow, I could tell that he was anxious.<br><sup>どことなく、不安そうにしている様子が見て取れる。</sup><br><sup>Somehow, I can see that he looked uneasy.</sup></p>
<p id="L24">He was probably nervous about his new surroundings.<br><sup>新しい環境に緊張しているのだろう。</sup><br><sup>They must be nervous about the new environment.</sup></p>
<p id="L25"><br></p>
<p id="L26">"Please sit down. Let's have dinner."<br><sup>「どうぞ座ってください。夕食にしましょう」</sup><br><sup>"Sit down, please.Let's have dinner."</sup></p>
<p id="L27"><br></p>
<p id="L28">"Yes."<br><sup>「はい」</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L29"><br></p>
<p id="L30">We took our seats across from each other and looked at the food on display.<br><sup>向かい合わせで席に着き、並べられている料理を見やる。</sup><br><sup>You sit face to face and look at the dishes on the table.</sup></p>
<p id="L31">The menu consisted of grilled fish, vegetables, and other things that Narson and his friends usually ate.<br><sup>焼き魚や野菜など、いつもナルソンたちが食べているような内容のメニューだ。</sup><br><sup>Grilled fish, vegetables, etc. are the same menu as Naruson's.</sup></p>
<p id="L32"><br></p>
<p id="L33">"Oh, no. Marie wasn't at the mansion, so the only ingredients for the dish are from here.<br><sup>「あ、しまった。マリーさんが屋敷にいなかったから、料理の食材がこっちのものだけだ」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my God.Mary wasn't in the house, so this is the only ingredient in the dish."</sup></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35">"Are you preparing food for Kazura-san, Marie?"<br><sup>「カズラさんの食事は、マリーさんが用意しているんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Is Mr. Kazura's meal prepared by Mr.</sup></p>
<p id="L36"><br></p>
<p id="L37">"Yes, she prepares everything for me from morning to night. She is a very good cook, so that helps a lot."<br><sup>「ええ、朝から晩まで、全部用意してもらってます。彼女、料理がすごく上手なんで助かってますよ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I have everything ready from morning till night.She's very good at cooking, so it's helpful."</sup></p>
<p id="L38"><br></p>
<p id="L39">In the beginning, it was all about reheating canned food with added meat and vegetables, but as we got used to it, Marie started cooking a variety of dishes for us.<br><sup>最初のうちは缶詰料理に肉や野菜を足して再加熱するといったものばかりだったが、慣れてくるにつれてマリーは色んな料理を作ってくれるようになった。</sup><br><sup>At first, all they did was add meat and vegetables to canned food and reheat it, but as she got used to it, Marie began to cook a variety of dishes.</sup></p>
<p id="L40">Her repertoire continues to expand as she bakes meat pies with wheat and meat, and makes fried rice (eggs are from our world) upon request.<br><sup>小麦と肉でミートパイを焼いてくれたり、リクエストに応えてチャーハン（卵はこちらの世界のもの）を作ってくれたりと、レパートリーは広がり続けている。</sup><br><sup>The repertoire continues to expand, baking meat pies with wheat and meat, and making fried rice (eggs from this world) on request.</sup></p>
<p id="L41">The latest hit is "Fruit Punch", which is a combination of canned fruit and fruits from this world mixed with sugar in a high alcohol content.<br><sup>最近のヒット作は、果物の缶詰とこちらの世界の果物を合わせて度数の高い酒に砂糖を混ぜた『なんちゃってフルーツポンチ』だ。</sup><br><sup>The most recent hit is "What a Fruit Punch," a combination of canned fruits and fruits from around the world mixed with sugar.</sup></p>
<p id="L42"><br></p>
<p id="L43">"I see. ...... Oh, um, if you don't mind, could I make some of Kazura-san's meals?"<br><sup>「そうなんですか……あ、あの、もしよければ、私にもカズラさんの食事を作らせてもらえませんか？」</sup><br><sup>"Really... oh, well, if you don't mind, could you let me cook Kazura's meal?"</sup></p>
<p id="L44"><br></p>
<p id="L45">"What, are you sure?<br><sup>「えっ、いいんですか！？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, is that all right!"</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">"Yes, I want to use the knife every day. I don't want my skills to become dull.<br><sup>「はい、包丁は毎日使っていたくて。腕が鈍ったら困りますし」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I want to use a kitchen knife every day.I'll be in trouble if my arm slows down."</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">"Wow, I'm so happy. I'd love to do it. I'll let Marie know later!"<br><sup>「うわー、嬉しいなぁ。ぜひお願いしたいです。後でマリーさんに言っておきますね！」</sup><br><sup>"I'm glad to hear that.I'd love to.I'll tell Mr. Marie later!"</sup></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51">"Yes, please."<br><sup>「はい、お願いします」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, please,"</sup></p>
<p id="L52"><br></p>
<p id="L53">Baretta smiled at Ichiran, who looked very happy.<br><sup>とても嬉しそうにしている一良に、バレッタはにっこりと微笑んだ。</sup><br><sup>Valletta smiled at Ichira, who looked very happy.</sup></p>
<p id="L54">For a long time, she had been determined that she would be the one to cook Ichiran's meals when he came here.<br><sup>こちらに来たら自分が一良の食事を作るのだと、前々から強く決心していたのだ。</sup><br><sup>He had long been determined that he would cook Ichira's meal when he came here.</sup></p>
<p id="L55">I didn't want to push too hard on anything else, but this was the one thing I couldn't compromise on.<br><sup>他においては無理を言うつもりはあまりなかったが、これだけは譲れなかった。</sup><br><sup>Other than that, I didn't mean to push myself too hard, but I couldn't give up on this.</sup></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">"But, Marie-san is treated as my personal cook and squire. Removing her from the cooking duties would put her in a bad position, so she can either cook with me or take my place."<br><sup>「あ、でも、マリーさんは私の専属料理人兼従者って扱いになってるんですよ。料理担当から外すと彼女の立場がまずいことになるんで、一緒に料理するか代わりばんこってかたちにしてもらえると」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, but you're treated as my exclusive cook and servant.If you leave her in charge of cooking, she will be in a bad situation, so I'd like to ask her to cook with me.</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">"I see. ...... I understand. I'll talk to her about it."<br><sup>「そうなんですか……分かりました。彼女と相談しますね」</sup><br><sup>"I see... I see.I'll talk to her."</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">"Baretta's cooking is really good. I'm looking forward to it."<br><sup>「バレッタさんの作る料理は本当に美味しいからなあ。いやあ、楽しみだ」</sup><br><sup>"Because the food that Valletta cooks is really delicious.Well, I'm looking forward to it."</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63">"Heh, you can count on it. If you want, I can go make you something now."<br><sup>「えへへ、期待しててください。もしよかったら、今から何か作ってきましょうか？」</sup><br><sup>"Look forward to it, hehe.If you don't mind, shall I make something for you now?"</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">"I'm going to eat it as it is. I'll just eat it as it is. I'll be fine if I eat some canned food later."<br><sup>「んー……いや、それだとこれを作ってくれた人に悪いですし、このまま食べることにします。後で何か缶詰でも食べれば平気なんで」</sup><br><sup>"Well... no, that's bad for the person who made this, and I'll just eat it.I don't mind eating some canned food later."</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">"Oh, I've brought plenty of canned goods.<br><sup>「あ、缶詰ならたくさん持ってきてますよ」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, I've brought a lot of canned food."</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">Baretta got up from her seat and opened the box she had brought with her and took out a can of peaches from inside.<br><sup>バレッタは席を立つと、持ってきた箱を開けて中から桃缶を取り出した。</sup><br><sup>When Valletta left her seat, she opened the box and took out the peach can from inside.</sup></p>
<p id="L70"><br></p>
<p id="L71">"I brought most of the canned peaches I had at home. I think we had about thirty."<br><sup>「家にあった桃缶はほとんど持ってきちゃいました。確か30個くらいあったかな」</sup><br><sup>"I brought most of the peach cans I had at home.I think there were about thirty."</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">"You really like peach cans, don't you, Baretta-san? ...... Come to think of it, you must have quite a collection of empty cans, don't you?　I'll have to bring them back to Japan next time.<br><sup>「バレッタさん、本当に桃缶好きですよね……そういえば、空き缶とかかなり溜まってるんじゃないですか？　今度日本に持って帰らないと」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Valletta, you really like peach cans, don't you?Come to think of it, aren't there a lot of empty cans?I have to bring it back to Japan next time."</sup></p>
<p id="L74"><br></p>
<p id="L75">"I've put them all together in a vacant house in the village, so they'll be fine. Besides, there are many ways to use them."<br><sup>「村の空き家にまとめて置いてあるんで、大丈夫ですよ。それに、使い道も色々とありますし」</sup><br><sup>"It's all right because it's all in an empty house in the village.Besides, there are many ways to use it."</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">"What's the use?　Like using it as a pot plant?"<br><sup>「使い道？　鉢植え代わりにするとかですか？」</sup><br><sup>"How to use it? Like planting pots?"</sup></p>
<p id="L78"><br></p>
<p id="L79">"Let's see, ......, that's about it.<br><sup>「えっと……まあ、そんなところですね」</sup><br><sup>"Well... well, that's about it."</sup></p>
<p id="L80"><br></p>
<p id="L81">Baretta took a silver platter from the shelf, opened a can and brought it to the table.<br><sup>バレッタは棚から銀皿を取り出すと、缶詰をあけてテーブルに持ってきた。</sup><br><sup>Valletta took the silver plate off the shelf, opened the can and brought it to the table.</sup></p>
<p id="L82">As long as I can consume calories and feel full, I'll be fine for now if I pick up a can of peaches while eating the food prepared for me.<br><sup>カロリーが摂取できて満腹感が得られればいいので、用意された料理を食べながら桃缶をつまめばとりあえずはいいだろう。</sup><br><sup>It would be nice if you could eat calories and feel full, so if you pinch a peach can while eating the prepared food, it would be good for now.</sup></p>
<p id="L83">We both said "Itadakimasu" together and started eating our food.<br><sup>２人して『いただきます』をし、料理を食べ始める。</sup><br><sup>The two of us do "Thank you for the meal" and start eating.</sup></p>
<p id="L84"><br></p>
<p id="L85">"How is the village?　Are you getting along well with the people in the garrison?"<br><sup>「村はどんな様子ですか？　駐屯部隊の人たちとは上手くやってます？」</sup><br><sup>"What's the village like?"Are you getting along well with the garrison people?"</sup></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">"Yes, they are all very nice people, and we get along well with everyone in the village. Recently, they have started to grow fields outside the village, and the side of the canal has become a bean field.<br><sup>「はい、みんなすごくいい人たちで、村のみんなとも打ち解けて仲良くしてます。最近は村の外で畑も作り始めてて、水路の脇が豆畑になっていますよ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, they are all very nice people, and they are very friendly with everyone in the village.Recently, we've started growing fields outside the village, and the waterways are covered with bean fields."</sup></p>
<p id="L88"><br></p>
<p id="L89">Since all of the Kingsguard in the garrison unit were reservists, most of them were close to 50 years old.<br><sup>駐屯部隊の近衛兵たちは全員が予備役なため、年齢的に50歳近くの者が大半である。</sup><br><sup>Most of the guards in the garrison are 50 years old because they are reserve soldiers.</sup></p>
<p id="L90">As former members of the Kingsguard, they were all financially well-off.<br><sup>元近衛兵ということもあり、経済的に裕福な者たちばかりだ。</sup><br><sup>Because they are former guards, they are all financially wealthy.</sup></p>
<p id="L91">It had been a long time since they had worked in the military, and since the assignment was half a vacation, guarding a wealthy village, everyone seemed to be enjoying their work.<br><sup>楽隠居の暇な身分から久々の軍の仕事、しかも裕福な村の警備という半分休暇のような任務のため、皆が仕事を楽しんでいるようだった。</sup><br><sup>Everyone seemed to enjoy their work because of their leisure status in retirement, military service for the first time in a long time, and half-holiday duties such as guarding wealthy villages.</sup></p>
<p id="L92">In three months, half of them will be relieved of their duties and replaced by new personnel coming from Isteria.<br><sup>３ヵ月で半数が一旦任務を切り上げ、イステリアから新たにやってくる人員と交代する手はずとなっている。</sup><br><sup>In three months, half of them have completed their duties and will be replaced by new personnel coming from Israel.</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94">"I'm glad to hear it. I heard that the captain of the unit is Isaac's cousin, did you talk to him, Baretta?"<br><sup>「それはよかった。部隊の隊長はアイザックさんの従姉妹だと聞いていますが、バレッタさんは話しました？」</sup><br><sup>"That's good.I've heard that the captain of the unit is Isaac's cousin. Did Valletta tell you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L95"><br></p>
<p id="L96">"You must be Lady Silvestria. She used to teach me martial arts every day."<br><sup>「シルベストリア様ですね。あの方には毎日武術を教えてもらっていました」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Silvestria,"He taught me martial arts every day."</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">"Oh, the martial arts?　Oh, by the way, you said something about both martial arts and medicine during the day.<br><sup>「え、武術ですか？　そういえば、昼間に武術も医術もとか言ってましたね」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, martial arts?Come to think of it, martial arts is also a medical art during the day."</sup></p>
<p id="L99"><br></p>
<p id="L100">"Yes. I was taught swordsmanship, spearmanship, and riding techniques. I've only just learned them, so I'm not very good at them.<br><sup>「はい。剣術と槍術と、騎乗術を教えてもらいました。まだ習いたてなんで、へたっぴですけどね」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I was taught swordsmanship, spearmanship, and riding.I've just learned it, so I'm not very good at it."</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">When I looked at Baretta's hand, which was smiling at me, I could see a scar that looked like a crushed blister from the gap between the fork she was holding in her right hand.<br><sup>そう言って微笑むバレッタの手を見てみると、右手に持っているフォークの隙間からマメが潰れたような痕が見えた。</sup><br><sup>When I looked at Valletta's smiling hand, I saw a mark of crushed beans through a gap in the fork in my right hand.</sup></p>
<p id="L103">If there are scars that you can see just by glancing at them, then your palms are probably covered in blisters.<br><sup>ちらりと見ただけで分かるような傷があるのなら、おそらく手のひらはマメだらけになっているのだろう。</sup><br><sup>If you have a scratch that you can tell by a glance, your palm is probably covered with beans.</sup></p>
<p id="L104"><br></p>
<p id="L105">"But I'm going to keep working hard to train and hone my skills. If anything happens, I'll protect you from now on, Kazura-san."<br><sup>「でも、これからも頑張って特訓して腕を磨くつもりです。何かあったら、これからは私がカズラさんを守りますね」</sup><br><sup>"But I will continue to do my best to improve my skills.If something happens, I'll protect Kazura from now on."</sup></p>
<p id="L106"><br></p>
<p id="L107">"Oh, thank you ......, that's kind of pathetic. Isn't it usually the other way around to say it?"<br><sup>「おお、ありがとう……って、何か情けないですね。普通、言う立場が逆なんじゃないだろうか」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, thank you... it's kind of pathetic.Usually, I think the opposite is true."</sup></p>
<p id="L108"><br></p>
<p id="L109">"It's not like that!　Until now, I've been protected by Kazura-san, and this is my way of returning the favor!"<br><sup>「そ、そんなことないですよ！　今までは私がカズラさんに守ってもらってましたから、そのお返しです！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that's not the case!"I've been protected by Kazura, so I'll give it back to you!"</sup></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111">Kazuyoshi laughed at Baretta's slightly flustered remark.<br><sup>少し慌てたように言うバレッタに、一良は笑ってしまった。</sup><br><sup>Ichira laughed at Valletta, who seemed a little flustered.</sup></p>
<p id="L112">She used to be such a weak girl that she couldn't even lift a bag of rice, but she has become much more reliable.<br><sup>以前は米袋すら持ち上げられないような非力少女だったのに、ずいぶんと頼もしくなったものだ。</sup><br><sup>She used to be a powerless girl who couldn't even lift a rice bag, but she became very reliable.</sup></p>
<p id="L113">He was so dependable that it even made me feel as if my incompetence was being highlighted.<br><sup>あまりにも頼もしすぎて、逆に自分の非力さが際立つような気さえしてきてしまう。</sup><br><sup>It's so reliable that I even feel like my weakness stands out.</sup></p>
<p id="L114">I don't feel like I can compete with them in terms of technology or motivation.<br><sup>技術力といいやる気といい、太刀打ちできるような気がしない。</sup><br><sup>I don't feel like I can compete with technology and good motivation.</sup></p>
<p id="L115"><br></p>
<p id="L116">What did you learn of the medical arts?"]<br><sup>「医術はどんなことを学んだんです？]</sup><br><sup>...</sup></p>
<p id="L117"><br></p>
<p id="L118">"I've basically memorized the book, but I've also tried dissection and surgery on animals I've caught in the mountains. I've never tried it on a human being, so I'll have to go learn from a doctor in town."<br><sup>「基本的に本の丸暗記ですけど、山で捕まえた動物を使って解剖や手術もしてみました。人間では試したことがないんで、今度街のお医者さんに習いに行かないと」</sup><br><sup>"It's basically book memorization, but I tried dissecting and operating on animals caught in the mountains.I've never tried it as a human being, so I have to go learn from a doctor in the city next time."</sup></p>
<p id="L119"><br></p>
<p id="L120">"Or surgery for dissection? How did you do that? ......"<br><sup>「か、解剖に手術ですか。よくできますね……」</sup><br><sup>"Or an autopsy and surgery?"You can do it well..."</sup></p>
<p id="L121"><br></p>
<p id="L122">"It was really difficult. We tried amputation and suturing of the leg while the patient was still alive, but the forceps (a scissors-like tool used to stop bleeding) we made were not enough to stop the bleeding. ......<br><sup>「本当に難しかったですよ。生きたまま足の切断と縫合とかも試してみたんですけど、血管の止血に使う<ruby><rb>鉗子</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>かんし</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>（ハサミのような形状の止血用の道具）が作った分だけじゃ足りなくて……」</sup><br><sup>"It was really difficult.I tried amputating and suturing my feet alive, but it wasn't enough that the forceps (hemostatic tools shaped like scissors) used to stop blood vessels..."</sup></p>
<p id="L123"><br></p>
<p id="L124">"You even made your own tools?"<br><sup>「道具まで自作したんですか」</sup><br><sup>"Did you even make your own tools?"</sup></p>
<p id="L125"><br></p>
<p id="L126">"Yes, it was relatively easy because I made it out of bronze. I managed to bind the blood vessels with thread, but unlike the anatomical charts, the nerves were not painted in white, so it took me a long time to find them. ...... The suturing of the muscles and skin was not so good, and I still need more training. I still need more training.<br><sup>「はい、青銅を加工して作ったんで、比較的簡単でした。それで、鉗子が使えない血管は糸で縛ってなんとかしたんですけど、解剖学の図譜と違って神経の色が白塗りされてるわけじゃないので探すのに手間取って……筋肉の縫い合わせと皮膚の縫合もイマイチだったし、まだまだ修行が足りないです」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, it was made from bronze, so it was relatively easy.So, I managed to tie the blood vessels that I couldn't use forceps with thread, but unlike the anatomy chart, the color of the nerves was not white-coated, so it took time to find them... the suture of the muscles and the suture of the skin was not good, and I still don't have enough training."</sup></p>
<p id="L127"><br></p>
<p id="L128">"Well, if you did that while it was still alive, wouldn't the animal have gone quite wild with pain?"<br><sup>「あの、生きたままそんなことやったら、その動物は痛みでかなり暴れたんじゃないですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, wouldn't that have caused the animal to go wild with pain?"</sup></p>
<p id="L129"><br></p>
<p id="L130">"Oh, that was okay. I used anesthesia."<br><sup>「あ、それは大丈夫でした。麻酔を使ったんで」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that was all right.I used anesthesia."</sup></p>
<p id="L131"><br></p>
<p id="L132">"What, anesthesia?"<br><sup>「え、麻酔？」</sup><br><sup>"What, anesthesia?"</sup></p>
<p id="L133"><br></p>
<p id="L134">"Yes, it's anesthesia.<br><sup>「はい、麻酔です」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, anesthesia."</sup></p>
<p id="L135"><br></p>
<p id="L136">Baretta nodded to Kazuyoshi, who looked at her suspiciously.<br><sup>怪訝な顔をしている一良に、バレッタが頷く。</sup><br><sup>Valletta nods to Ichira, who looks suspicious.</sup></p>

<p id="L138">"I gave him a cloth full of undiluted chamomile essential oil to sniff, and burned lavender in the room we used for the surgery.

<p id="L139"><br></p>
<p id="L140">Since chamomile has sedative and analgesic properties, Barletta must have wondered if it could be applied as an anesthetic.<br><sup>カモミールには鎮静と鎮痛の作用があるので、バレッタはそれを麻酔として応用できないだろうかと考えたのだろう。</sup><br><sup>Chamomile has sedative and analgesic effects, so Valletta wondered if she could apply it as an anesthetic.</sup></p>
<p id="L141">This is a trick that can only be used by creatures from our world, where the effects of essential oils are strong.<br><sup>精油の効果が強く出る、こちらの世界の生物だからこそ使える芸当だ。</sup><br><sup>It's an art that can be used because it's a living thing in this world that has a strong effect on essential oils.</sup></p>
<p id="L142">By the way, the act of directly sniffing undiluted liquid for a long time is too stimulating and dangerous, so it should not be done in general.<br><sup>ちなみに、原液を直接長時間かぐという行為は刺激が強すぎて危険なので、普通は行ってはならない。</sup><br><sup>By the way, the act of directly sniffing the stock solution for a long time is too stimulating and dangerous, so it should not be done normally.</sup></p>

<p id="L157"><br></p>
<p id="L158">"Yes. So we've dug 150 wells with the well digger so far, but only five have produced water. ......

<p id="L163"><br></p>
<p id="L164">"Yes. As soon as it reached the vein, the water would seep out, and if we spread out around it, we could pump it out steadily.<br><sup>「ええ。水脈に達するとすぐに水が染み出してきて、周りを広げれば安定して汲みだせるような感じでしたね」</sup><br><sup>"Yes.

Oh, so you built a blast furnace instead of a ren furnace!　I mean, what did you do with the refractory bricks for the blast furnace?　The ones you brought with you weren't enough, were they?"<br><sup>「……え、レン炉じゃなくて高炉を作ったんですか！？　ていうか、高炉に使った耐火レンガはどうしたんです？　持って行った分だけじゃ足りなかったでしょう？」</sup><br><sup>"...what, did you make a blast furnace instead of a brick furnace!?I mean, what's wrong with the refractory bricks used in the blast furnace?Wasn't it enough to take?"</sup></p>

<p id="L291">On the screen of the computer was a document about the military reform that took place in Barbert three years ago, as well as a document about the peace with the barbarians.<br><sup>パソコンの画面には、バルベールで３年前に行われた軍制改革についての資料と、蛮族との和平についての資料が映し出されていた。</sup><br><sup>The computer screen showed data on military reform and peace with barbarians three years ago in Valver.</sup></p>

<p id="L300">The reason for this was that I read the materials in chronological order, in order of oldest to newest.<br><sup>時系列順に見ていこうと、資料を古い順に読んでいったのが原因である。</sup><br><sup>The reason is that they read the data in chronological order.</sup></p>

<p id="L302">"The truce was four years ago, and the military reform was three years ago. The production of wood has been gradually increasing since then, with the sharpest increase about a year and a half ago.

After a year, they had a good idea of how to make the technology work, so they decided to reform the military system. I guess."<br><sup>「休戦したのが４年前で、軍制改革が３年前。その頃から徐々に木材の生産量が増えてて、急激な増加が１年半前ってとこか。戦時中に錫が枯渇した時に代用品として製鉄技術を発明したけど、実用化が間に合わないと判断して休戦を申し出たと……それから１年でなんとか技術をものにできる目処が立って、これならいけると軍政改革に踏み切ったってところだろうな」</sup><br><sup>"The armistice was four years ago and the military system reform was three years ago.Since then, wood production has gradually increased, and the sharp increase was a year and a half ago.He invented ironmaking technology as a substitute during the war when tin was depleted, but decided that it would not be practical in time, so he proposed a truce... and in a year he managed to get the technology, so he would have reformed the military and government."</sup></p>
<p id="L303"><br></p>
<p id="L304">There was a note in the corner of the document that said, 'A large tin vein is believed to have been discovered,' but based on the unusual increase in wood production, Kazuyoshi assumed that they were probably making iron.<br><sup>資料の隅には『大規模な錫鉱脈が発見されたと思われる』とメモ書きがされているが、木材生産量の異常な増え方から、製鉄を行っているのだろうと一良は踏んでいた。</sup><br><sup>In the corner of the data, there is a memo saying, "I think a large-scale tin vein has been discovered," but Ichira suspected that ironmaking was being carried out due to the abnormal increase in wood production.</sup></p>
<p id="L305">I was going to mention it when I talked to Baretta earlier, but I decided not to because I thought she would be frightened.<br><sup>先ほどバレッタと話した時にも口にしようとしたのだが、バレッタが怯えていると思い、言うのを取りやめたのだ。</sup><br><sup>I tried to say it when I spoke to Valletta earlier, but she thought she was scared, so I stopped saying it.</sup></p>
<p id="L306"><br></p>
<p id="L307">If there is no information about the new metal in the documents, it means that the other side is keeping the steel production secret.<br><sup>新たな金属についての情報が資料に書かれていないとなると、相手は製鉄について秘匿してるということになる。</sup><br><sup>If information about the new metal is not written in the data, it means that the other party is confidential about steelmaking.</sup></p>
<p id="L308">There is only one reason to keep the existence of iron making technology a secret, even though it has been established.<br><sup>せっかく製鉄技術を確立したにもかかわらず、その存在を秘匿するとなると理由は１つしかない。</sup><br><sup>There is only one reason why ironmaking technology has been established, but its existence has been kept secret.</sup></p>
<p id="L309">He probably intends to crush Arcadia, which has not even imagined the existence of iron, with the power of iron weapons as soon as the war starts.<br><sup>鉄の存在を想像すらしていないアルカディアを、鉄器の力で開戦と同時に一気に粉砕するつもりなのだろう。</sup><br><sup>Arcadia, which does not even imagine the existence of iron, is likely to be crushed at once by the power of iron.</sup></p>
