<p id="L1">Meanwhile, back then.<br><sup>一方その頃。</sup><br><sup>On the other hand, at that time.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">In a carpenter's workshop in the city, Baretta and Arondo watched the screw press being made.<br><sup>街なかにある大工工房では、バレッタとアロンドがスクリュープレスの製造を見守っていた。</sup><br><sup>In a carpenter's workshop around town, Valletta and Alondo watched the screw press manufacturing.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">Originally, Arondo was not going to be here, and Baretta was going to be the one to check the work progress.<br><sup>本来ならばアロンドがこの場に来る予定はなく、作業進捗の確認はバレッタが１人で行う予定だった。</sup><br><sup>Originally, Alondo was not scheduled to come here, and Valletta was supposed to check the progress of the work alone.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">However, Arondo, who had heard from somewhere that Baretta was coming to the workshop, was waiting for her at the workshop before she arrived.<br><sup>だが、バレッタが工房に来るという話をどこからか聞きつけたアロンドが、彼女が来るよりも先に工房で待機していたのだ。</sup><br><sup>But Arond, who heard that Valletta was coming to the workshop from somewhere, was waiting in the workshop before she came.</sup></p>
<p id="L5"><br></p>
<p id="L6">"I see. With this kind of system, you can press the oil slowly with less power.<br><sup>「なるほどねぇ。こういう仕組みなら、少ない力でゆっくり油を搾れるのか」</sup><br><sup>"I see,"With this kind of system, can you squeeze oil slowly with less force?"</sup></p>
<p id="L7"><br></p>
<p id="L8">Arondo watched with admiration as the screw press was assembled by the carpenters.<br><sup>大工職人の手によってスクリュープレスが組み立てられていくさまを、アロンドは感心した様子で見つめている。</sup><br><sup>Arond looked admiringly at the screw press being assembled by a carpenter.</sup></p>
<p id="L9"><br></p>
<p id="L10">"The parts are manufactured individually in each workshop, which is very efficient, and I'm sure we'll be able to get enough of them soon. I'm sure we'll be able to get a lot of them soon.<br><sup>「部品は工房ごとの個別製造で効率がいいし、この分ならすぐに数を揃えられそうだね。現場の評判も上々みたいだし、君の設計は大したものだよ」</sup><br><sup>"Parts are manufactured separately from one workshop to the next, and I think I can get the numbers right away.The reputation of the site seems to be good, and your design is great."</sup></p>
<p id="L11"><br></p>
<p id="L12">"Thank you very much. Now, I'd better go to ......."<br><sup>「ありがとうございます。では、私はそろそろ……」</sup><br><sup>"Thank you very much.Well, it's about time for me..."</sup></p>
<p id="L13"><br></p>
<p id="L14">"Yes, I have a favor to ask you. I don't want to take up too much of your time, but I was wondering if you could help me with something."<br><sup>「そうそう、ちょっと君に頼みたいことがあるんだよ。あまり時間は取らせないからさ、少し手伝ってくれないかな？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I have a favor to ask of you.I won't spare you much time, will you help me a little?"</sup></p>
<p id="L15"><br></p>
<p id="L16">"Yes, yes."<br><sup>「は、はい」</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L17"><br></p>
<p id="L18">She was about to leave when she was stopped, and Baretta gave her a slightly tight smile.<br><sup>帰ろうとしたところを引き留められ、バレッタは若干引きつった笑みを返した。</sup><br><sup>As she was about to leave, Valletta returned a slightly twitchy.</sup></p>
<p id="L19">Since the beginning of the year, Baretta had been taken out by Alondo in this way many times.<br><sup>年が明けてからというもの、バレッタは幾度となくこうしてアロンドにあちこちへと連れ出されていた。</sup><br><sup>After the beginning of the year, Valletta had been taken here and there by Alond many times.</sup></p>
<p id="L20">In the beginning, it was just a little help, and after a few minutes of standing around talking, they were released, but recently, the time restraints were gradually getting longer.<br><sup>初めのうちはちょっとした手伝いだけで、数分立ち話をした後には解放されていたのだが、最近では徐々に拘束時間が長くなってきていた。</sup><br><sup>At first he had only a little help, and after a few minutes of standing and talking he had been freed, but these days his detention hours were gradually lengthening.</sup></p>
<p id="L21">Just a few days ago, he took me to a fancy restaurant to discuss the work process, and we ended up having lunch together.<br><sup>つい数日前も、「作業工程の相談をしたい」と言われて小洒落た飲食店に連れて行かれ、そのまま２人で昼食をとることになってしまった。</sup><br><sup>Just a few days ago, he was taken to a fancy restaurant because he wanted to discuss the work process, and we had to have lunch together.</sup></p>
<p id="L22">As for Baretta, she doesn't mind that Arondo asks her for a job or for advice.<br><sup>バレッタとしては、アロンドから仕事を頼まれたり相談を持ち掛けられることは一向に構わない。</sup><br><sup>For Valletta, it doesn't matter at all if Alondo asks her for a job or asks her for advice.</sup></p>
<p id="L23">I didn't mind, but I was honestly quite troubled about the fact that he and I would be forced to do some sort of date in conjunction with it.<br><sup>構わないのだが、それに付随して彼と２人でデートのようなことをさせられることに関しては、正直かなり困っていた。</sup><br><sup>I don't mind, but honestly, I was quite at a loss as to having him do something like a date with him.</sup></p>
<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25">"But it's almost noon, so let's go somewhere to eat and talk. I'll send an envoy to the villa."<br><sup>「あ、でも、そろそろお昼だし、一緒にどこかで食事でもしながら話そうか。屋敷には使いを出しておくよ」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, but it's almost lunchtime, so let's have dinner together somewhere.I'll send an errand to the house."</sup></p>
<p id="L26"><br></p>
<p id="L27">"Well, um, I was wondering if you could do that after you finish your meal, because I have to go back to ...... and prepare lunch for Kazura-san."<br><sup>「えっ、あの、それなら食事を済ませた後にしていただけると……戻ってカズラさんの昼食の支度をしないといけないので……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, then, if you could do it after you finish your meal... I have to go back and get ready for Kazura's lunch..."</sup></p>
<p id="L28"><br></p>
<p id="L29">"Well, well, well. It's not like there aren't alternatives."<br><sup>「まあまあ、いいじゃないか。代わりの人間がいないわけでもないんだしさ」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's all right, isn't it?It's not that there's no replacement."</sup></p>
<p id="L30"><br></p>
<p id="L31">Arondo said lightly, putting his hand on Baretta's back and leading her out.<br><sup>アロンドは軽い調子で言いながらバレッタの背に手を添えると、そのまま外へと連れ出した。</sup><br><sup>Alond put his hand on Valletta's back lightly and took him out.</sup></p>
<p id="L32">Baretta had no choice but to get into a parked carriage.<br><sup>バレッタは仕方なしに、停められていた馬車に乗り込む。</sup><br><sup>Valletta had no choice but to get into the parked carriage.</sup></p>
<p id="L33">Then Arondo sat down next to Baretta, as he should have.<br><sup>すると、アロンドは当然のようにバレッタの隣に腰かけた。</sup><br><sup>Alond sat down next to Valletta, as if he were right.</sup></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35">"There's a place a little far from here that serves good meat. I'll be there today. ......"<br><sup>「ここから少し離れてるけど、美味しい肉料理を出す店があるんだ。今日はそこで……」</sup><br><sup>"It's a little far from here, but there's a restaurant that serves delicious meat dishes.I'll be there today..."</sup></p>
<p id="L36"><br></p>
<p id="L37">"Oh, um!　Preferably somewhere close to ......."<br><sup>「あ、あの！　できれば近いところで……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, you know! If possible, close..."</sup></p>
<p id="L38"><br></p>
<p id="L39">"It's .......<br><sup>「……キミさ」</sup><br><sup>"...you,"</sup></p>
<p id="L40"><br></p>
<p id="L41">Arondo gave a slightly troubled look to Baretta, who couldn't help but express her opinion.<br><sup>思わず意見を出したバレッタに、アロンドは少し困ったような表情を向けた。</sup><br><sup>Arond looked a little troubled at Valletta, who had given her an opinion without thinking.</sup></p>
<p id="L42"><br></p>
<p id="L43">"I think you'd better give up on him.<br><sup>「彼のことは、諦めたほうがいいと思うよ」</sup><br><sup>"I think you'd better give up on him."</sup></p>
<p id="L44"><br></p>
<p id="L45">"What?<br><sup>「え？」</sup><br><sup>"What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">"I'm talking about you, Kazura-sama. You know it's impossible, don't you?　You know it's impossible, don't you? How are you going to get between two people who are so close?<br><sup>「カズラ様のことだよ。無理だってことは分かってるんだろ？　あんなに仲のいい２人の間に、どうやって割り込もうっていうのさ」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Kazura,"You know it's impossible, don't you?How do you get in between such a close couple?"</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">Baretta looked at Arondo with a puzzled expression at his sudden remark.<br><sup>突然の物言いに、バレッタはぽかんとした表情でアロンドを見た。</sup><br><sup>At the sudden remark, Valletta looked at Alondo blankly.</sup></p>
<p id="L50">Arondo chuckled and apologized, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<br><sup>アロンドは苦笑して、「ごめん、ごめん」と謝ってみせる。</sup><br><sup>Alondo smiles bitterly and apologizes, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."</sup></p>
<p id="L51"><br></p>
<p id="L52">"But with Liese-sama as your opponent, I don't think you stand a chance. You may think it's okay to be a concubine, but there's no way Liese-sama or Narson would allow that. You'll be forced to pay a reasonable amount of money at the right time, and you'll either be sent back to your village or to a distant city.<br><sup>「でも、相手がリーゼ様じゃ、キミに勝ち目はないと思うよ。妾でもいいってキミは思ってるかもしれないけど、リーゼ様やナルソン様がそんなこと許すはずがないしさ。折をみて適当な額の金を押し付けられて、そのまま村に帰されるか遠い街に飛ばされるかがオチだよ」</sup><br><sup>"But if your opponent is Liese, I don't think you have a chance.You may think it's okay to be a concubine, but Liese and Narson can't forgive that.It's a punchline whether you'll be forced to go back to the village or fly to a distant city at the right time."</sup></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54">"......"<br><sup>「……」</sup><br><sup>「……」</sup></p>
<p id="L55"><br></p>
<p id="L56">"It may be hard on him, but it would be even worse if he were to throw away his chance at a promotion, right?　If things continue like this, I can assure you that it will happen. I think you'd better give up on him as soon as possible rather than go through that."<br><sup>「彼のことはつらいかもしれないけど、せっかく手にした出世のチャンスを棒に振るのはもっと嫌だろ？　このままいったら、絶対にそうなると断言してもいい。そんな目に遭うくらいなら、さっさと彼のことは諦めたほうがいいんじゃないかな」</sup><br><sup>"It may be painful for him, but you don't want to throw away all the chances of success, do you? If you don't do that, you can swear that it will definitely happen.I think it's better to give up on him as soon as possible than to have such an experience."</sup></p>
<p id="L57"><br></p>
<p id="L58">"...... What are you trying to say?"<br><sup>「……何が言いたいんですか」</sup><br><sup>"...what do you want to say?"</sup></p>
<p id="L59"><br></p>
<p id="L60">Arondo smiled at Baretta, who lowered her voice.<br><sup>声のトーンを落としたバレッタに、アロンドは微笑みかける。</sup><br><sup>Alond smiles at Valletta, who has lost her tone.</sup></p>
<p id="L61"><br></p>
<p id="L62">"Come work for me. I promise you a good career and I'll arrange for your family to live in Isteria. I'll make you and your family wealthy for the rest of your life in this city. That is, if you'll be mine."<br><sup>「俺のところに来なよ。出世は約束するし、いずれキミの家族もイステリアに住めるように手を回そう。家族共々、この街で一生裕福な生活を送らせてあげるよ。キミが俺のものになってくれるなら、ね」</sup><br><sup>"Come to me.I promise you a successful career, and eventually I'll help your family live in Isteria.I'll let you both live a rich life in this city for the rest of your life.If you'll be mine, I'll tell you."</sup></p>
<p id="L63"><br></p>
<p id="L64">"......"<br><sup>「……」</sup><br><sup>「……」</sup></p>
<p id="L65"><br></p>
<p id="L66">"It's not a bad idea, is it?　Fortunately, Kazura-sama said that if you want, he can take you under his wing. If you want, I can tell Kazura-sama. ......"<br><sup>「どうだい、悪い話じゃないだろう？　幸い、キミが望めば俺の下には付けてくれるみたいなことをカズラ様は言ってたしさ。何なら、俺からカズラ様に伝えてあげても……」</sup><br><sup>"What do you think, isn't it a bad story?"Fortunately, Kazura said something that you would put under me if you wanted.If you want, I can tell Kazura-sama..."</sup></p>
<p id="L67"><br></p>
<p id="L68">"Why?"<br><sup>「どうして」</sup><br><sup>"Why not?"</sup></p>
<p id="L69"><br></p>
<p id="L70">"Yeah?"<br><sup>「うん？」</sup><br><sup>"Huh?"</sup></p>
<p id="L71"><br></p>
<p id="L72">"Why are you telling me this?<br><sup>「どうして、そんなお話を？」</sup><br><sup>"Why did you tell me such a story?"</sup></p>
<p id="L73"><br></p>
<p id="L74">Valletta asks in a quiet tone.<br><sup>静かな口調のまま、バレッタが問う。</sup><br><sup>asked Valletta, in a quiet tone.</sup></p>
<p id="L75">Arondo snorted, "Hmm," as he thought for a few moments.<br><sup>アロンドは数瞬、考えるように「んー」と唸った。</sup><br><sup>Arond groaned thoughtfully for a few moments.</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">"I like you so much ......, or maybe it's because I like you. I like you so much that I want to make you mine at all costs.<br><sup>「キミをすごく気に入った……いや、好きになったから、かな。なんとしても俺のものにしたいくらいに」</sup><br><sup>"I really like you... no, I guess it's because I fell in love with you.I want to make it mine at all costs."</sup></p>
<p id="L78"><br></p>
<p id="L79">Baretta kept a straight face and stared into Alondo's eyes.<br><sup>バレッタは真顔のまま、アロンドの瞳をじっと見つめる。</sup><br><sup>Valletta stared straight into Alond's eyes.</sup></p>
<p id="L80">At the look in his eyes, Arondo's smile faded and he opened his mouth with a serious expression.<br><sup>その眼差しに、アロンドは微笑みを消して真剣な表情で口を開いた。</sup><br><sup>Arond smiled and spoke with a serious expression.</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">"To be honest, I'm also calculating. You're Kazura-sama's and Narson-sama's favorite, and you're good friends with Liese-sama. Above all, you have a great talent for inventing tools and machines. If you can be my right-hand man, it'll be a good thing for the future. But that's just an added bonus. I need a woman as kind and smart as you next to me."<br><sup>「正直、打算もあるよ。キミはカズラ様やナルソン様のお気に入りだし、リーゼ様とも仲がいい。なにより、道具や機械の発明にかけては抜きんでた才能を持ってる。キミが俺の右腕になってくれるなら、将来的にいいことづくめだろう。でも、それはおまけみたいなものだよ。俺は、キミのような優しくて賢い女性に隣にいて欲しいんだ」</sup><br><sup>"To be honest, there are calculations.You are a favorite of Kazura and Naruson, and you are also close to Liese.Above all, he has an outstanding talent for inventing tools and machines.If you were to be my right arm, I would be full of good things in the future.But it's like a free gift.I want a kind and smart woman like you to be next to me."</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">It seemed to Arondo that Baretta's eyes wavered a little at that line.<br><sup>その台詞に、バレッタの瞳が少しだけ揺れたようにアロンドには見えた。</sup><br><sup>The line seemed to make Valletta's eyes shake a little.</sup></p>
<p id="L85"><br></p>
<p id="L86">"I don't know, leave the compound and come to me at ......."<br><sup>「どうかな、屋敷を離れて俺のところに……」</sup><br><sup>"I don't know, leave the house and come to me..."</sup></p>
<p id="L87"><br></p>
<p id="L88">"I'm sorry!"<br><sup>「ごめんなさい！」</sup><br><sup>"I'm sorry!"</sup></p>
<p id="L89"><br></p>
<p id="L90">Before Arondo could finish, Valletta bowed her head vigorously.<br><sup>アロンドが言い終わる前に、バレッタが勢いよく頭を下げた。</sup><br><sup>Valletta bowed her head vigorously before Alondo finished.</sup></p>
<p id="L91">Arondo froze with his mouth open at the reaction, which was the exact opposite of what he expected.<br><sup>予想とは正反対の反応に、アロンドは口を開いたまま固まってしまう。</sup><br><sup>Arond clumps open at the opposite reaction.</sup></p>
<p id="L92"><br></p>
<p id="L93">"It's a really good story, but I can't accept it. Thank you very much for your kind words. I'll leave you now.<br><sup>「本当にいいお話ですが、お受けすることはできないです。私なんかにもったいないお話、本当にありがとうございました。今日はこれで失礼いたします」</sup><br><sup>"It's a very good story, but I can't accept it.Thank you very much for telling me such a wasteful to me.I beg your pardon for today."</sup></p>
<p id="L94"><br></p>
<p id="L95">Baretta bowed her head and apologized in one breath, then turned and put her hand on the carriage door so she wouldn't see Alondo's face.<br><sup>バレッタは頭を下げたまま一息に謝罪を述べると、アロンドの顔を見ないように振り返って馬車の戸に手をかけた。</sup><br><sup>Valletta apologized with her head down, and turned around to put her hand on the carriage door so as not to look at Alond's face.</sup></p>
<p id="L96">Arondo hurriedly grabbed Baretta by the shoulders to hold her back.<br><sup>アロンドは慌てて、バレッタの肩を掴んで引き留める。</sup><br><sup>Alondo hastily grabs Valletta by the shoulder and holds her back.</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">"Hey, hey!　Why can't I just go to ...... and see if it's still running?　What the hell is wrong with you?<br><sup>「ちょ、ちょっと！　まだ走行中……じゃなくて、どうしてダメなんだ！？　いったい、何が気に入らないんだよ！？」</sup><br><sup>"Hey! I'm still driving... but why can't I!?What on earth don't you like?"</sup></p>
<p id="L99"><br></p>
<p id="L100">Baretta looked back slightly at Alondo and smiled a little sadly.<br><sup>バレッタはアロンドに僅かながら振り返ると、少し寂しそうに微笑んだ。</sup><br><sup>Valletta turned slightly back to Alond and smiled a little lonely.</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">"It's not that I don't like it or that I don't like it.<br><sup>「気に入るとか気に入らないとかじゃ、ないんです」</sup><br><sup>"It's not that I like it or I don't like it,"</sup></p>
<p id="L103"><br></p>
<p id="L104">"Well, then, why?<br><sup>「じゃ、じゃあ、どうして！？」</sup><br><sup>`Then why!'</sup></p>
<p id="L105"><br></p>
<p id="L106">Valletta turned to the front and opened the door.<br><sup>バレッタは正面に向き直り、戸を開けた。</sup><br><sup>Valletta turned to the front and opened the door.</sup></p>
<p id="L107">The sound of wheels rolling on the ground rattled loudly in the room.<br><sup>ガラガラと地面を転がる車輪の音が、ひと際大きく室内に響く。</sup><br><sup>The rattle of wheels rolling on the ground echoes louder indoors.</sup></p>
<p id="L108"><br></p>
<p id="L109">"...... I have to be that person."<br><sup>「……私は、あの人じゃないとダメなんです」</sup><br><sup>"...I have to be him."</sup></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111">When she finished, Baretta jumped from the carriage.<br><sup>言い終えると、バレッタはぴょんと馬車から跳んだ。</sup><br><sup>When she had finished, Valletta jumped out of the carriage.</sup></p>
<p id="L112">He landed dexterously on the ground, and in a flash, his figure disappeared from the view of the doorway.<br><sup>器用に地面に着地し、あっという間にその姿が戸口の景色から消える。</sup><br><sup>He skillfully lands on the ground and disappears from the view of the doorway in no time.</sup></p>
<p id="L113">Arondo stared at the doorway for a moment, then reached for the open door and slammed it shut.<br><sup>アロンドはしばらく戸口を見つめ、開きっぱなしになった戸に手を伸ばし、ばたんと勢いよく閉めた。</sup><br><sup>Arond stared at the door for a moment, reached for the open door, and slammed it shut.</sup></p>
<p id="L114">I sat back in my seat and clicked my tongue.<br><sup>どかりと席に腰を下ろし、チッと舌を鳴らす。</sup><br><sup>Sit down and snap your tongue.</sup></p>
<p id="L115"><br></p>
<p id="L116">"Normally, you'd be a little shaken up after all that."<br><sup>「普通、あれだけ言われたら、少しくらいは揺れるだろ」</sup><br><sup>"Usually, if you say that much, it'll shake a little."</sup></p>
<p id="L117"><br></p>
<p id="L118">He mumbled in a very grumpy voice.<br><sup>すこぶる不機嫌な声で、つぶやいた。</sup><br><sup>muttered he, in a very sullen voice.</sup></p>
<p id="L119"><br></p>
<p id="L120"><br></p>
<p id="L121"><br></p>
<p id="L122">At the same time, in the workroom of the Narson residence, Isaac was setting beans in the de-oil machine.<br><sup>その頃、ナルソン邸の作業部屋では、アイザックが脱油機に豆をセットしていた。</sup><br><sup>At that time, Isaac was putting beans in a de-oiler in the studio of Narson's house.</sup></p>
<p id="L123">Lock the top cover tightly and press the power button.<br><sup>上蓋をしっかりとロックし、電源ボタンを押す。</sup><br><sup>Lock the upper lid firmly and press the power button.</sup></p>
<p id="L124">As I watched the oil come out with a sound like the rumbling of the earth, the door to the room opened and Marie walked in.<br><sup>地鳴りのような音とともに油が出てくる様子を見守っていると、部屋の扉が開いてマリーが入ってきた。</sup><br><sup>As I watched the oil coming out with a rumbling sound, the door of the room opened and Marie came in.</sup></p>
<p id="L125">In each hand, he holds a large wooden box stacked two-high.<br><sup>両手には、２段重ねにされた大きな木箱を抱えている。</sup><br><sup>In his hands he held a large wooden box in two layers.</sup></p>
<p id="L126">Marie peeked over the side of the crate and gave a small bow to Isaac.<br><sup>マリーは木箱の脇に顔を覗かせると、アイザックに小さく頭を下げた。</sup><br><sup>Mary peeped at the side of the crate and bowed her head to Isaac.</sup></p>
<p id="L127"><br></p>
<p id="L128">"I brought you some more beans. Kazura-sama and Zirconia-sama will not be back for a while. In the meantime, Mr. Isaac would like you to continue working. I will assist you until it is time to prepare lunch."<br><sup>「追加の豆をお持ちいたしました。カズラ様とジルコニア様は、しばらく戻られないとのことです。その間、アイザック様は作業を続けるようにとのことです。私は昼食の支度の時間までお手伝いいたします」</sup><br><sup>"I have brought you some extra beans.Kazura-sama and Zirconia-sama will not be able to return for a while.Meanwhile, Mr. Isaac told me to continue the work.I'll help you until lunch is ready."</sup></p>
<p id="L129"><br></p>
<p id="L130">"Hmm, okay. Bring those beans over here."<br><sup>「ん、分かった。その豆はこっちに持ってきてくれ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, sir.Bring the beans over here."</sup></p>
<p id="L131"><br></p>
<p id="L132">"Yes, sir."<br><sup>「かしこまりました」</sup><br><sup>"Very well,"</sup></p>
<p id="L133"><br></p>
<p id="L134">Marie strode up to Isaac and set the crate down with a careful motion.<br><sup>マリーはスタスタとアイザックの下まで来ると、丁寧な動作で木箱を下ろした。</sup><br><sup>Mary came under Stasta and Isaac and carefully lowered the crate.</sup></p>
<p id="L135"><br></p>
<p id="L136">"...... Hmm."<br><sup>「……ふむ」</sup><br><sup>"... well,"</sup></p>
<p id="L137"><br></p>
<p id="L138">Isaac reached for the crate that Marie had just set down and held them up together as she had done.<br><sup>アイザックは今しがたマリーが置いた木箱に手を伸ばし、彼女がそうしていたようにそれを２つまとめて抱え上げた。</sup><br><sup>Isaac reached for the crate Mary had just placed, and, as she had done, he held it up in two.</sup></p>
<p id="L139">He stared at the crate, as if checking its hefty weight, and then glanced at Marie.<br><sup>そのずっしりとした重みを確かめるように木箱を見つめ、ちらりとマリーに目を向けた。</sup><br><sup>He glanced at the crate and glanced at Mary, confirming its heavy weight.</sup></p>
<p id="L140"><br></p>
<p id="L141">"How did you manage to bring something so heavy?"<br><sup>「こんな重いもの、よく持ってこれたな」</sup><br><sup>"How could you carry such a heavy thing?"</sup></p>
<p id="L142"><br></p>
<p id="L143">"Huh?　Yes, yes!"<br><sup>「えっ？　は、はい！」</sup><br><sup>"What? Yes!"</sup></p>
<p id="L144"><br></p>
<p id="L145">"Wasn't it heavy?"<br><sup>「重くなかったか？」</sup><br><sup>"Wasn't it heavy?"</sup></p>
<p id="L146"><br></p>
<p id="L147">"Oh, it was heavy, but I could barely hold it. ......<br><sup>「お、重かったですが、ギリギリ持てるくらいで……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, it was heavy, but I could barely hold it..."</sup></p>
<p id="L148"><br></p>
<p id="L149">"Okay.<br><sup>「そうか」</sup><br><sup>"I see,"</sup></p>
<p id="L150"><br></p>
<p id="L151">Isaac set the crate down and turned his attention to the de-oiling machine.<br><sup>アイザックは木箱を下ろすと、脱油機に目を向けた。</sup><br><sup>Isaac put down the crate and turned to the de-oiler.</sup></p>
<p id="L152">The two of us stood side by side, silently watching the de-oiler as it shook and rattled.<br><sup>ガタガタと揺れる脱油機を、２人並んで黙って見つめる。</sup><br><sup>The two of them stood side by side staring at the rattling de-oiler.</sup></p>
<p id="L153"><br></p>
<p id="L154">"...... recently."<br><sup>「……最近」</sup><br><sup>"...recently,"</sup></p>
<p id="L155"><br></p>
<p id="L156">"Yes?"<br><sup>「はい？」</sup><br><sup>"What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L157"><br></p>
<p id="L158">After a moment of silence, Marie turned her head to Isaac, who had said the words with his eyes on the de-oiler.<br><sup>しばらくの沈黙の後、脱油機に目を向けたまま言葉を発したアイザックに、マリーは顔を向けた。</sup><br><sup>After a moment's silence, Mary turned to Isaac, who spoke with her eyes fixed on the oil absorber.</sup></p>
<p id="L159"><br></p>
<p id="L160">"What's going on with you lately?"<br><sup>「最近、何かあったのか？」</sup><br><sup>"What has happened recently?"</sup></p>
<p id="L161"><br></p>
<p id="L162">"What?"<br><sup>「えっ？」</sup><br><sup>"What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L163"><br></p>
<p id="L164">"You've been looking kind of down for the last month or so.<br><sup>「ここ1ヵ月くらい、ずっと元気がないように見えてな」</sup><br><sup>"You don't look well for the past month or so."</sup></p>
<p id="L165"><br></p>
<p id="L166">"No, no, nothing like that. ......<br><sup>「い、いえ、特にそのようなことは……」</sup><br><sup>"No, no, especially such a thing..."</sup></p>
<p id="L167"><br></p>
<p id="L168">"What's going on with you and Havel?"<br><sup>「ハベルと、何かあったんじゃないのか？」</sup><br><sup>"Didn't something happen to Hubbard?"</sup></p>
<p id="L169"><br></p>
<p id="L170">"What?"<br><sup>「えっ」</sup><br><sup>"What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L171"><br></p>
<p id="L172">Isaac glanced at Marie, who shouted in surprise.<br><sup>驚いた声を上げるマリーに、アイザックはちらりと目を向ける。</sup><br><sup>Isaac glances at Mary, who screams in surprise.</sup></p>
<p id="L173"><br></p>
<p id="L174">"I knew it. I've noticed that you guys have been acting strangely awkward lately. I've been asking him about it, but he's just not getting it. It's been a long time, but you still haven't solved it?<br><sup>「やはりそうか。最近、お前たちが妙にぎくしゃくして見えたんだ。あいつにもそれとはなしに聞いてみたんだが、とぼけられてしまってな。ずいぶん経っているが、まだ解決しないのか」</sup><br><sup>"I see.You guys look strangely awkward these days.I asked him about it, but he played the fool.It's been a long time, but hasn't it been solved yet?"</sup></p>
<p id="L175"><br></p>
<p id="L176">"......"<br><sup>「……」</sup><br><sup>「……」</sup></p>
<p id="L177"><br></p>
<p id="L178">Marie turned over and looked down at her feet.<br><sup>マリーは俯き、足元に視線を落としている。</sup><br><sup>Mary looked down and lowered her eyes to her feet.</sup></p>
<p id="L179">Isaac also turned his attention back to the de-oiler.<br><sup>アイザックも脱油機に目を戻した。</sup><br><sup>Isaac also looked back at the de-oiler.</sup></p>
<p id="L180"><br></p>
<p id="L181">"I don't know what's going on with you, but it's not something you can solve by yourself, is it?　It might be a good idea to talk to someone about it. You might want to talk to someone about it, because sometimes complaining can change your mood."<br><sup>「何があったのか知らないが、１人で悩んでいても解決しないことなのだろう？　誰かに話してみるのもいいかもしれないぞ。愚痴って気分が切り替えられることもあるからな」</sup><br><sup>"I don't know what happened, but is it something that can't be solved even if you're alone? Maybe you should talk to someone.Sometimes you can change your mind by complaining."</sup></p>
<p id="L182"><br></p>
<p id="L183">Isaac said in a light-hearted tone, assuming that he must have had a fight with Havel.<br><sup>きっとハベルと喧嘩でもしてしまったのだろう、と見当をつけて、軽い調子でアイザックは言う。</sup><br><sup>Guessing that he must have had a fight with Hubbard, Isaac says lightly.</sup></p>
<p id="L184">Marie didn't reply and remained downcast.<br><sup>マリーは返事もせず、俯いたままだ。</sup><br><sup>Mary didn't answer and kept her head down.</sup></p>
<p id="L185"><br></p>
<p id="L186">"If you don't have anyone to talk to, you can talk to me, okay?　I'll never tell anyone, and if you want, I can come in and give him a lecture. I'm not going to tell anyone, and if you want, I can come in and give him a lecture. Haha ......"<br><sup>「話せる相手がいなければ、俺に話してくれてもいいぞ？　絶対に他言なんてしないし、何なら俺が間に入ってあいつに説教してやったっていい。こんなかわいい妹を悲しませるなんて何事だ、ってな。はは……」</sup><br><sup>"If you don't have anyone to talk to, you can talk to me.I'll never say anything else, and if you like, I can come in and preach to him.What's the matter with making such a lovely sister sad?Haha..."</sup></p>
<p id="L187"><br></p>
<p id="L188">"......"<br><sup>「……」</sup><br><sup>「……」</sup></p>
<p id="L189"><br></p>
<p id="L190">When Marie didn't respond at all, Isaac's forehead was sweating as he searched for words.<br><sup>まったく反応を返さないマリーに、アイザックは額に汗を浮かべて言葉を探す。</sup><br><sup>Isaac looks for words with sweat on his forehead when Marie doesn't respond at all.</sup></p>
<p id="L191">Thinking about it, even Baretta and Eira, who see her on a regular basis, haven't been able to get anything out of her (probably).<br><sup>思えば、日頃から彼女と顔を合わせているバレッタやエイラですら、何も聞き出せていない（たぶん）のだ。</sup><br><sup>If you think about it, even Valletta and Ayla, who usually meet her, haven't heard anything (probably).</sup></p>
<p id="L192">There was no way that Marie would confide in me, with whom she had only had a few conversations, about her problems.<br><sup>会話も数えるほどしかしたことがない自分に、マリーが悩みを打ち明けるはずがない。</sup><br><sup>Marie can't tell her worries to herself, who has only had a few conversations.</sup></p>
<p id="L193">In fact, I think it may have atrophied them in the opposite direction.<br><sup>むしろ、逆に萎縮させてしまっているのでは。</sup><br><sup>On the contrary, I think it's shrinking.</sup></p>
<p id="L194">That thought crossed my mind.<br><sup>そんな考えが頭をもたげる。</sup><br><sup>Such an idea raises my head.</sup></p>
<p id="L195"><br></p>
<p id="L196">"I'm sure you'll find it easier to talk with other women. I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but it's a good idea. You can talk to someone about it or discuss it with Havel when the time comes. ......"<br><sup>「そ、そうは言っても、やはり同じ女同士のほうが話しやすいか。まあ、あまり悩んでいても辛いだけだからな。折を見て誰かに話すなり、ハベルと話し合ってみるなり……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, after all, is it easier to talk to the same woman?Well, even if you worry too much, it's just hard.As soon as I talked to someone, I talked to Hubbard..."</sup></p>
<p id="L197"><br></p>
<p id="L198">"...... really."<br><sup>「……本当に」</sup><br><sup>"...really,"</sup></p>
<p id="L199"><br></p>
<p id="L200">"Hmm?"<br><sup>「ん？」</sup><br><sup>"Huh?"</sup></p>
<p id="L201"><br></p>
<p id="L202">The muffled voice caught his ear slightly, and Isaac turned his head to Marie, stopping his words.<br><sup>かすれるような声が微かに耳に入り、アイザックはマリーに顔を向け、言葉を止めた。</sup><br><sup>A hoarse voice came into his ear, and Isaac turned to Mary and stopped talking.</sup></p>
<p id="L203">Marie remained depressed and I could not see her expression.<br><sup>マリーはうつむいたままで、その表情を見ることはできない。</sup><br><sup>Mary looks down and can't see her expression.</sup></p>
<p id="L204"><br></p>
<p id="L205">"Are you sure you want to keep the ...... secret?"<br><sup>「本当に……秘密は守って、くださいますか？」</sup><br><sup>"Really... will you keep a secret?"</sup></p>
<p id="L206"><br></p>
<p id="L207">"Oh, my God!　Of course!　I swear on the name of my ancestors!"<br><sup>「あ、ああ！　もちろんだ！　祖先の名に誓おう！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, oh! Of course!I swear to my ancestors!"</sup></p>
<p id="L208"><br></p>
<p id="L209">Marie slowly turned her head to Isaac, who answered immediately.<br><sup>即答するアイザックに、マリーはゆっくりと顔を向けた。</sup><br><sup>Mary slowly turned to Isaac, who answered immediately.</sup></p>
<p id="L210">Marie's eyes were filled with tears, threatening to overflow at any moment.<br><sup>マリーの瞳は涙で満ちており、今にもあふれてしまいそうだ。</sup><br><sup>Mary's eyes are filled with tears and are about to overflow.</sup></p>
<p id="L211"><br></p>
<p id="L212">"Help me ...... please ......"<br><sup>「助けて……ください……」</sup><br><sup>"Help me... please..."</sup></p>
<p id="L213"><br></p>
<p id="L214">Marie pleaded with a sullen look on her face.<br><sup>すがるような表情で、マリーは懇願した。</sup><br><sup>With a clinging look on her face, Marie begged.</sup></p>
