<p id="L1">After dinner that night.<br><sup>その日の夕食後。</sup><br><sup>After dinner that day.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">In the workroom next to his room, Kazuyoshi was explaining the performance of the surveillance cameras he had laid out on the table.<br><sup>一良は自室の隣にある仕事部屋で、テーブルに並べた監視カメラの性能を説明していた。</sup><br><sup>Ichira was explaining the performance of the surveillance cameras on the table in his workroom next to his room.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">There were four people in the room, Ichira and the Narson family, and Baretta was not here because she was helping Marie clean up dinner.<br><sup>部屋にいるのは一良とナルソン一家の４人で、バレッタはマリーを手伝って夕食の片付けをしているためここにはいない。</sup><br><sup>There are four people in the room, Ichira and the Nelson family, and Valletta is not here because she is helping Marie clean up dinner.</sup></p>
<p id="L4"><br></p>
<p id="L5">"In the future, when I have important business dealings with people from other countries or territories, I will use this surveillance camera to record what happened. With this, even if the other party tries to renege on the deal, I will have proof and won't be able to escape. Also, I can use the receiver over here to watch the video that this camera is showing."<br><sup>「今後、他国や他領の人と重要な取引をする際は、この監視カメラを使ってその時の様子を記録しようと思います。これさえあれば、相手がその時の話を反故にしようとしても証拠があるので逃げられません。あと、このカメラが映している映像をこっちの受信機を使って見ることができます」</sup><br><sup>"From now on, I will use this surveillance camera to record important transactions with people from other countries and other territories.If you have this, you can't run away because you have evidence even if the other person tries to reverse the story.Also, you can use this receiver to see the video that this camera is showing."</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">"Are these different from the tools you showed me before for taking pictures?"<br><sup>「これって、前に見せてもらった写真を撮る道具とは違うの？」</sup><br><sup>"Is this different from the tool you showed me before?"</sup></p>
<p id="L8"><br></p>
<p id="L9">Liese asks, gazing at the dome-shaped surveillance camera.<br><sup>ドーム状の監視カメラをしげしげと眺めながら、リーゼが問う。</sup><br><sup>Liese asks, looking closely at the dome-shaped surveillance camera.</sup></p>
<p id="L10"><br></p>
<p id="L11">"The purpose is similar but a little different. It's not a still image like a photograph, but a record of movement that can be viewed over and over again. Well, you can do something similar over there if you want to.<br><sup>「用途は似てるけどちょっと違うかな。こっちは写真みたいな静止画じゃなくて、動いてる様子をそのまま記録として残して何度でも見返せるんだ。まあ、あっちでもやろうと思えば似たようなことはできるけど」</sup><br><sup>"The purpose is similar, but I think it's a little different.This is not a still image like a picture, but you can keep a record of it moving and look back many times.Well, if you want to do it over there, you can do something similar."</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">"Hmmm... ...... is more convenient for the kind of use you were talking about, right?　"It's called a "surveillance" camera.<br><sup>「んー……こっちのほうがさっき言ってたような用途には便利ってことだよね？　“監視”カメラっていうくらいだし」</sup><br><sup>"Well... this is more convenient for use like I said earlier, right?"It's even called a "monitoring" camera."</sup></p>
<p id="L14"><br></p>
<p id="L15">"Yes, yes. Also, it's for security purposes, just in case. Even if something happens during the transaction, we can come to you immediately if you're in another room watching."<br><sup>「そうそう。あと、一応防犯用にもなるな。たとえ取引の際に何かあっても、別室で監視していればすぐに駆けつけられる」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, and just in case, it's for crime prevention.Even if something happens during a transaction, if you monitor it in a separate room, you will be able to come quickly."</sup></p>
<p id="L16"><br></p>
<p id="L17">"I see. That's one way to use it.<br><sup>「そっか、そういう使い方もあるんだね」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's the way it'said he.</sup></p>
<p id="L18"><br></p>
<p id="L19">Kazura looked at Lise, who looked impressed, and glanced at Narson and Zirconia.<br><sup>感心している様子のリーゼを一良は見つつ、ナルソンとジルコニアをちらりと見た。</sup><br><sup>Ichira looked at Liese, who looked impressed, and glanced at Narson and Zirconia.</sup></p>
<p id="L20">They both nodded their heads, looking like they were 'going to be okay.<br><sup>２人とも、『大丈夫そうだ』といった様子で頷いてみせた。</sup><br><sup>They both nodded, "It looks all right."</sup></p>
<p id="L21">I had told them about the camera in advance, and they knew why I was using it for Lise and what it could do.<br><sup>２人には前もってカメラのことは話してあり、リーゼのために使うといった理由も器具の性能も承知している。</sup><br><sup>They talked about the camera in advance, and they know the reason why they use it for Liese and the performance of the instrument.</sup></p>
<p id="L22"><br></p>
<p id="L23">"I don't think I'll be using the images stored in this unless I have to, but I thought I'd bring it along just in case. I'll keep it hidden in a potted plant in the room I use for visits. Also, this is called a security buzzer. ......"<br><sup>「まあ、よほどのことがない限りはこれに保存した映像を使うことはないとは思いますが、念のためにと思って持って来ました。面会に使う部屋の鉢植えの中にでも潜ませておくことにしましょう。あとこれ、防犯ブザーっていうんですが……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I don't think I'll use the video I saved in this unless it's a big deal, but I brought it just in case.Let's hide in the potted plants in the room we're going to visit.And this is called a crime prevention buzzer..."</sup></p>
<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25">As I was explaining the items, there was a knock on the door and Marie came in.<br><sup>そうして品物の説明をしていると、扉がノックされてマリーが入ってきた。</sup><br><sup>I was explaining the goods when the door was knocked and Mary came in.</sup></p>
<p id="L26"><br></p>
<p id="L27">"Mr. Kazura, Mr. Arondo has arrived. They are currently waiting for you in the parlor."<br><sup>「カズラ様、アロンド様がご到着なされました。現在、応接室にてお待ちいただいております」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Kazura, Mr. Alondo has arrived.You are now waiting in the drawing-room."</sup></p>
<p id="L28"><br></p>
<p id="L29">"Oh, okay. I'll be right there. ...... Hmm?　What's wrong with you, Marie?　Are you feeling sick?"<br><sup>「あ、分かりました。すぐに行きます……ん？　マリーさん、どうかしました？　体調でも悪いんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, I see.I'll be right there... Huh?What's the matter, Marie?Are you feeling sick?"</sup></p>
<p id="L30"><br></p>
<p id="L31">Marie's expression seemed a little gloomy, and when Kazuyoshi called out to her, she looked impatient.<br><sup>マリーの表情が少し暗いような気がして一良が声をかけると、彼女は焦ったような表情になった。</sup><br><sup>Marie's expression seemed a little dark, so when Ichira spoke to her, she looked impatient.</sup></p>
<p id="L32"><br></p>
<p id="L33">"No, no, not at all. Thank you for your concern."<br><sup>「い、いえ、そんなことは。お気遣い、ありがとうございます」</sup><br><sup>"No, no, that's not the case.Thank you for your concern."</sup></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35">Marie's mind kept swirling with the story of Noor this morning, and she could hardly even eat.<br><sup>マリーは今朝のノールの話がずっと頭に渦巻いており、食事すらほとんど食べられないような状態だった。</sup><br><sup>Marie's conversation with Noll this morning had been raging in her head, and she could hardly even eat.</sup></p>
<p id="L36">After that, Marie went to give Havel a souvenir, and he took it without a care in the world, and when he heard that Marie had also received it, his face broke into a smile.<br><sup>あの後マリーはハベルにお土産を渡しに行ったのだが、彼は何食わぬ様子でお土産を受け取り、マリーももらったと聞くと表情を綻ばせていた。</sup><br><sup>After that, Marie went to give Hubbell a souvenir, but when he heard that he had received it without looking at it, his expression was smiling.</sup></p>
<p id="L37">Marie was unable to say anything to him because he behaved in such a normal manner, and she suffered alone when she returned to the mansion.<br><sup>そのあまりにも普段どおりな態度に、マリーは彼に何も言い出すことができず、屋敷に戻ってきてからも１人で苦悩していた。</sup><br><sup>Marie couldn't say anything to him because of her usual manner, and even after coming back to the house she was suffering alone.</sup></p>
<p id="L38">He wanted to tell someone about it and ask them to help him, but he understood that if he did not, it could cost his father and brother their lives.<br><sup>誰かにこの話をして助けてもらいたいが、下手をすると父と兄の命を奪うことになりかねないと理解していたからだ。</sup><br><sup>I want someone to tell me this and help me, but I understand that if I don't do it properly, I'll kill my father and brother.</sup></p>
<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">"But you don't look well, do you?　But you look pale. I'll tell the other maids."<br><sup>「でも、顔色が悪いですよ？　今日はもう仕事はいいので休んでください。他の侍女さんには私から言っておきますから」</sup><br><sup>"But you look pale, don't you?I'm done with work today, so please take a break.I'll tell the other ladies first."</sup></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42">"...... No, no!　I'm really fine!<br><sup>「っ……いっ、いえ！　本当に大丈夫ですので！」</sup><br><sup>"... no! It's really all right!"</sup></p>
<p id="L43"><br></p>
<p id="L44">Marie looked as if she was trying to hold back tears for a moment, and Kazuyoshi wondered if something had happened with Arondo.<br><sup>泣きそうになるのを堪えるような表情を一瞬見せたマリーに、アロンドと何かあったのだろうかと一良は心配になった。</sup><br><sup>Ichira was worried that something might have happened to Marie, who looked like she was going to cry for a moment.</sup></p>
<p id="L45">However, if he insists that he is that fine, there is no choice.<br><sup>だが、本人がそこまで大丈夫だと言い張るのでは仕方がない。</sup><br><sup>However, it can't be helped if he insists that he is all right.</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">"Hmmm ...... I understand. But please don't take it too hard, okay?"<br><sup>「うーん……分かりました。でも、無理はしないでくださいね？」</sup><br><sup>"Well... I see.But don't push yourself too hard, will you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">"Yes. Thank you."<br><sup>「はい。ありがとうございます」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, thank you very much."</sup></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51">So Kazuyoshi accompanied Marie to the reception room.<br><sup>そうして一良はマリーを伴い、応接室へと向かった。</sup><br><sup>Then Ichira accompanied Marie to the drawing-room.</sup></p>
<p id="L52"><br></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54"><br></p>
<p id="L55">A few minutes later. Kazura was sitting across the table from Alondo, receiving a report on the salt lake survey.<br><sup>数分後。一良はアロンドとテーブルに向かい合って座り、塩湖調査の報告を受けていた。</sup><br><sup>A few minutes later, Ichira sat face to face at the table with Alondo and received a report on the salt lake investigation.</sup></p>
<p id="L56">The room, dimly lit by candlelight, was empty except for the two of us.<br><sup>蝋燭の灯りがぼんやりと照らす室内には、２人以外誰もいない。</sup><br><sup>There were no one but two in the dimly lit room.</sup></p>
<p id="L57">This was because Arondo had offered to meet with Kazuyoshi alone before reporting to Narson.<br><sup>というのも、ナルソンに報告する前に一良と２人きりで会いたいと、アロンドから申し出があったからだ。</sup><br><sup>for before reporting to Narson, Alond offered to meet him alone.</sup></p>
<p id="L58">Having had the painful experience of ignoring his previous advice not to talk about Liese to Zirconia, Kazuyoshi immediately agreed and has been doing so ever since.<br><sup>以前、ジルコニアにはリーゼの話をしないほうがいいという彼からの忠告を無視して痛い目に遭った経験のある一良はそれをすぐに了承し、今に至る。</sup><br><sup>Ichira, who had previously had a painful experience ignoring his advice not to talk about Liese to Zirconia, readily agreed to it and continues to this day.</sup></p>
<p id="L59"><br></p>
<p id="L60">"According to the spies' report, we did not find what appears to be the salt lake that Kazura-sama mentioned earlier. Instead, we found a strange village in an inland basin.<br><sup>「間者の報告では、以前カズラ様がおっしゃっていた塩湖とみられるものは見つかりませんでした。ですが、代わりに内陸の盆地に妙な村が見つかりました」</sup><br><sup>"In the report of Mr. Kazura, we could not find what appeared to be a salt lake.But instead, I found a strange village in the inland basin."</sup></p>
<p id="L61"><br></p>
<p id="L62">"Strange village?<br><sup>「妙な村？」</sup><br><sup>"A strange village?"</sup></p>
<p id="L63"><br></p>
<p id="L64">"Yes. According to my research, it seems that clay is being mined and transported out of the village. However, the destination is a port town along the coast of Gregorian territory that is famous for its salt production. ...... I'm not sure what they need so much clay for.<br><sup>「はい。その村には毎日のように荷馬車が何台も出入りしているようでして、調査によるとどうやら粘土を採掘して運び出しているようなのです。ですが、その運び先がグレゴルン領内の海岸沿いにある塩の産地として有名な港町でして……何のためにそれほど粘土が必要なのか、よく分からないのです」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, there are many carts coming in and out of the village almost every day, and research shows that they are mining and transporting clay.But it's a famous salt-producing port town on the coast of Gregorne... I'm not sure why we need so much clay."</sup></p>
<p id="L65"><br></p>
<p id="L66">"Maybe they're using the ships to export it somewhere.　Or maybe they're using them to make bricks or something."<br><sup>「船を使ってどこかに輸出してるんじゃないですか？　もしくは、レンガか何かを作るのに使っているとか」</sup><br><sup>"Don't you use ships to export them to somewhere?"Or they use them to make bricks or something."</sup></p>
<p id="L67"><br></p>
<p id="L68">"I thought about it, but the cost of transporting clay all the way to the ship seemed a bit high. They seem to be making bricks and pottery, but there seems to be a lack of balance between the amount being transported and the amount being consumed.<br><sup>「それも考えましたが、わざわざ船を使ってまで粘土を輸送というのは費用を考えると少々厳しいかと。レンガや陶器を作っている様子ではあるのですが、運びこまれる量と消費される量に釣り合いが取れていないようにみられるのです」</sup><br><sup>"I thought about that, but considering the cost of transporting clay all the way by boat, I think it's a little difficult.They seem to be making bricks and pottery, but they don't seem to be in proportion to how much they are brought in and consumed."</sup></p>
<p id="L69"><br></p>
<p id="L70">"Hmm. Does he look that blatantly strange?"<br><sup>「ふむ。そんなにあからさまにおかしい様子なんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, do you look so plainly strange?"</sup></p>
<p id="L71"><br></p>
<p id="L72">"Yes. It seems that all the cargo is brought to one facility, but it seems unnatural, since clay can be mined in the mountains or along rivers nearby. The quality of the clay doesn't seem to be extremely good, and I can't help but feel a bit confused. This is just my opinion, but I wonder if there is a new way of salt production using clay, or if there is a new way of salt production using ......".<br><sup>「はい。積荷は全て一箇所の施設に運び込まれているようなのですが、粘土なら近場の山や河川沿いでも採掘できるはずですし、どうにも不自然に感じられます。粘土の質がとびきりいいというわけでもなさそうですし、どうにも引っかかります。これは私の考えですが、粘土を使った新たな製塩方法が存在するのか、もしくは……」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, all the cargo seems to have been brought into one facility, but clay should be able to be mined along nearby mountains and rivers, and it seems unnatural.The quality of the clay doesn't seem to be outstanding, and I can't help but get stuck.This is my idea, but is there a new way of making salt using clay, or is there a way to make salt?"</sup></p>
<p id="L73"><br></p>
<p id="L74">"...... disguised as a clay transport, but actually hiding salt inside that clay?"<br><sup>「……粘土の輸送に見せかけて、実はその粘土の中に塩を隠している？」</sup><br><sup>"...do you actually hide salt in the clay under the guise of transporting clay?"</sup></p>
<p id="L75"><br></p>
<p id="L76">Alondo nodded at Kazuyoshi's words.<br><sup>一良の言葉に、アロンドが頷く。</sup><br><sup>Alond nods at Ichira's words.</sup></p>
<p id="L77"><br></p>
<p id="L78">"I wanted to investigate further, but the village is heavily guarded and I can't do anything about it. So I thought I'd report to Kazura-sama first."<br><sup>「もっと詳しく調べたかったのですが、その村は警備が厳重で下手に手を出せません。そこで、先にカズラ様に報告をと思いまして」</sup><br><sup>"I wanted to find out more, but the village is too heavily guarded to touch.Therefore, I would like to report to Kazura first."</sup></p>
<p id="L79"><br></p>
<p id="L80">"I see. ...... It may be that there is a salt mine underground.<br><sup>「なるほど……それはもしかしたら、地下に<ruby><rb>岩塩坑</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>がんえんこう</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>があるのかもしれないですね」</sup><br><sup>"Well... maybe there's a rock salt pit underground."</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">"Is it ......?　I've never heard that name before, is it different from a salt lake?"<br><sup>「がんえんこう……ですか？　初めて聞く名称なのですが、塩湖とは違うのですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Is it a rocky lake...?"This is the name I've never heard of, but is it different from Salt Lake?"</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">As Arondo asked back with a serious expression, Kazuyoshi opened his mouth, remembering an article in an encyclopedia he had read earlier.<br><sup>真剣な表情で聞き返すアロンドに、一良は以前読んだ百科辞典の記事を思い出しながら口を開く。</sup><br><sup>As he listened back with a serious expression, Ichira recalls the article in the encyclopedia he had read before.</sup></p>
<p id="L85"><br></p>
<p id="L86">"Roughly speaking, it is the same as a salt lake. When the water in the original salt lake has completely evaporated and salt has accumulated in layers underground, it is called a salt mine.<br><sup>「大まかに言えば塩湖と同じです。元々あった塩湖の水分が完全に蒸発して、地下に塩が層になって堆積した状態になったもののことをを岩塩坑というんです」</sup><br><sup>"Roughly speaking, it's the same as Salt Lake.When the water in the salt lake evaporates completely and salt is deposited underground, it is called a rock salt pit."</sup></p>
<p id="L87"><br></p>
<p id="L88">"I see. So you are saying that the village digs up clay from the nearby area, covers it with salt dug up from under the village, and transports it to the coast. Then they sell it everywhere, pretending that the salt is made on the coast.<br><sup>「なるほど。ということは、その村は近場で掘ってきた粘土を村の地下から掘り出した塩にかぶせて、沿岸地に運び出しているということですか。それをあたかも海岸で製塩したものとみせかけて、あちこちに売っていると」</sup><br><sup>"I see. Does that mean that the village carries the clay dug nearby to the coast with salt dug out of the village's basement?They sell it here and there, pretending to be salt produced on the beach."</sup></p>
<p id="L89"><br></p>
<p id="L90">"It's possible. Salt mines produce salt in a crystalline state, so if it is a salt mine, then it is no wonder that the quality of salt in Gregorian territory is outstanding.<br><sup>「その可能性はありますね。岩塩坑からは結晶の状態の塩が採れますから、もしそこが岩塩坑だというのならグレゴルン領の塩の品質がずば抜けていいっていうことも頷けます」</sup><br><sup>"There is a possibility.You can get crystalline salt from the rock salt pit, so if it's a rock salt pit, you can understand that the quality of salt in Gregorne is by far the best."</sup></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">"If that's the case, they're making a fortune off of the high quality salt they get without much effort. I see, that's how it is. ......"<br><sup>「そうだとしたら、たいした手間もかけずに手に入れた高品質な塩でぼろ儲けしているということになりますね。なるほど、そういうことだったのか……」</sup><br><sup>"If that's the case, you're making a lot of money off of the high-quality salt you got without much trouble.I see, that's what it was like...</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94">Arondo nodded deeply in admiration at Kazura's explanation.<br><sup>一良の説明に、アロンドは感心した様子で深く頷いた。</sup><br><sup>Arond nodded deeply at Ichira's explanation.</sup></p>
<p id="L95">In his mind, it seems that he has already determined that this is the truth.<br><sup>彼の中では、すでにそれが真相だと断定されているようだ。</sup><br><sup>It seems to him that it has already been concluded that it is true.</sup></p>
<p id="L96"><br></p>
<p id="L97">"Then I will proceed with further investigation along those lines. There is a high possibility that Lord Dias is also involved, so if that is the case, I will use that as a story to threaten Lord Nibel."<br><sup>「では、その線でさらに調査を進めます。領主のダイアス様も一枚噛んでいる可能性が高いので、もしその場合はそれもネタに使ってニーベル殿に脅しをかけようと思います」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I'll go further on that line.There is a high possibility that Mr. Diaz, the lord, has bitten one, and in that case I will use it as a joke to threaten Lord Nibel."</sup></p>
<p id="L98"><br></p>
<p id="L99">"A threat?<br><sup>「脅し、ですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Threat?"</sup></p>
<p id="L100"><br></p>
<p id="L101">As Ichiran tilted his head, Arondo smirked.<br><sup>首を傾げる一良に、アロンドはにやりとした表情を浮かべた。</sup><br><sup>Arond smiled at Ichira, who tilted his head.</sup></p>
<p id="L102"><br></p>
<p id="L103">"Yes. Perhaps Nibel-dono's statement about reducing the salt trade by 50% is just a bluff to play into Liese's hands. If Lord Dias is aware of the existence of the salt mines and has entrusted the entire salt business to Lord Nibel, he will soon revise the trading volume by saying that the weather has slightly improved or some other reason.<br><sup>「はい。おそらく、塩の取引量を５割減にするとニーベル殿が言ったのは、リーゼ様を手篭めにするためのハッタリです。もしダイアス様が岩塩坑の存在を知っているうえで製塩事業の全権をニーベル殿に任せているのだとしたら、近いうちに『若干天候が持ち直した』とか何とか理由をつけて取引量を修正してくるでしょう」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, Mr. Nibel said he would probably cut the salt trade by 50 percent, which was a perfect match for Liese.If Mr. Diaz knew the existence of the rock salt pit and left all the power of the salt production business to Mr. Nibel, he would soon revise the volume of the transaction, citing reasons such as 'the weather has improved a little.'"</sup></p>
<p id="L104"><br></p>
<p id="L105">"Hmm ......, so does that mean that if Mr. Dias doesn't know about the existence of the rock salt mines, the volume of transactions will remain at 50% less?"<br><sup>「んー……てことは、岩塩坑の存在をダイアスさんが知らない場合は、取引量は５割減のままってことですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Well... does lever mean that if Mr. Diaz doesn't know about the existence of the rock salt pit, the volume of transactions will remain reduced by 50 percent?"</sup></p>
<p id="L106"><br></p>
<p id="L107">"That's right. If Mr. Daias doesn't know about the existence of the salt mines and Nibel-dono is seriously trying to get his hands on Mr. Liese, he might get stubborn and continue to reduce the volume of business until we raise our voice. However, if Mr. Diaz is involved in the salt mine business, there's no way he would allow us to lose out on a ridiculous amount of profit because of his personal feelings. The reason why we haven't received any official notice of the volume reduction yet is because he's probably trying to figure out when he's going to propose a volume revision.<br><sup>「その通りです。ダイアス様が岩塩坑の存在を知らず、ニーベル殿が本気でリーゼ様を手篭めにしようとしているのなら、彼も言い出した手前意地になってこちらが音を上げるまで取引量の減量を続けてくるかもしれません。ですが、もしダイアス様が岩塩坑の事業に噛んでいるとしたら、そのような私情のためにバカみたいに儲け損ねをするような真似を許すはずがありません。未だに正式な取引量減の通達が来ないのは、取引量修正を言い出す時期を図っているのではないでしょうか」</sup><br><sup>"That's right.If Mr. Diaz doesn't know about the existence of the rock salt pit and Mr. Nibel is serious about putting Liese in his hands, he may continue to reduce the volume of transactions until I make a noise.However, if Mr. Diaz bites the rock salt pit business like a fool.forgive someone's sakeThe reason why we still haven't received a formal notice of a decrease in transaction volume is probably because we're trying to come up with a revised transaction volume."</sup></p>
<p id="L108"><br></p>
<p id="L109">This time Ichiran nodded in admiration at Arondo's reasoning.<br><sup>アロンドの推論に、今度は一良が感心して頷いた。</sup><br><sup>This time Ichira nodded admiringly at Alond's reasoning.</sup></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111">"I see. ...... So I guess we'll just have to wait until they say something, then?<br><sup>「なるほどねえ……それなら、あっちが何か言ってくるまで、私たちは待ってればいいってことですかね？」</sup><br><sup>"Well... then, do you mean we should wait until they say something?"</sup></p>

<p id="L117">"It's fun and exciting, but how about extorting them to the point of making them throw away all the money they've made? If he's been doing this privately, he's probably accumulated a lot of money, so let's take it all.

<p id="L154">Baretta was not dressed in her maidservant's uniform, but in her own clothes, so he thought she was the daughter of some nobleman.<br><sup>バレッタは侍女服姿ではなく私服だったため、どこかの貴族の娘だと思ったのだ。</sup><br><sup>Valletta thought she was the daughter of a nobleman, because she was not dressed as a maid, but in plain clothes.</sup></p>

<p id="L170">"We are currently constructing a large number of the same barracks that the military garrisons build for wintering in the villages and towns we are moving to.

<p id="L174">"Of course. We use a workshop with lumbering machines to mass-produce our products in a streamlined manner, so it's quite inexpensive.
