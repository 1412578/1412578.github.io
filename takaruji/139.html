<p id="L1">"I see. You still don't understand. ......<br><sup>「そっか、やっぱり分かりませんか……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, don't you understand?"</sup></p>
<p id="L2"><br></p>
<p id="L3">As the LED lights on the ceiling glittered in the room, Kazuyoshi sighed with a blank expression on his face.<br><sup>天井のＬＥＤライトが煌々と室内を照らす中、一良は浮かない表情でため息をついた。</sup><br><sup>As the LED lights on the ceiling shone brightly in the room, Ichira sighed with a brooding expression.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">I looked down at the report that Isaac had just given me and flipped through it.<br><sup>今しがたアイザックから渡された報告書に目を落とし、ぱらぱらとめくってみる。</sup><br><sup>I just looked down at the report that Isaac gave me and flipped through it.</sup></p>
<p id="L5">It listed all the known folk medicinal preparations and their efficacy, and even detailed the distribution of their ingredients.<br><sup>そこには民間で知られている薬の調合法と効能が羅列されており、それらの材料の分布まで細かく記載されていた。</sup><br><sup>It lists the preparation methods and efficacy of medicines known to the private sector, and even the distribution of these ingredients is described in detail.</sup></p>
<p id="L6">So far, Isaac had done all he could to find out.<br><sup>今までアイザックがほうぼうに手を尽くし、調べ上げたものだ。</sup><br><sup>So far, Isaac has done everything he can to find out.</sup></p>
<p id="L7"><br></p>
<p id="L8">"I understand that these medicines have been handed down from generation to generation, but what are their effects?<br><sup>「これらの薬は民間で伝わっているものということですが、効能的にはどんな具合なんです？」</sup><br><sup>"You say these drugs are handed down in the private sector, but how are they effective?"</sup></p>
<p id="L9"><br></p>
<p id="L10">"It depends on the type of medicine, but if it is not too serious, it will work enough. If those medicines don't cure you, you will have to use the sorcerer's medicine."<br><sup>「薬の種類にもよりますが、あまり重篤なものでなければ事足りる程度には効き目があります。それらの薬でも治らない場合は呪術師の薬を使うことになります」</sup><br><sup>"It depends on the type of medicine, but if it's not too serious, it's effective enough.If those drugs don't cure you, you'll have to use a magician's medicine."</sup></p>
<p id="L11"><br></p>
<p id="L12">"And that sorcerer's potion is ridiculously expensive."<br><sup>「で、その呪術師の薬がバカみたいに高いと」</sup><br><sup>"And the magician's medicine is ridiculously expensive,"</sup></p>
<p id="L13"><br></p>
<p id="L14">"Yes. If you have a disease that cannot be cured by the medicine, we also offer prayers, but they are more expensive.<br><sup>「はい。その薬でも治らないような病気の場合は祈祷も行いますが、それはさらに高額です」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, if you have a disease that doesn't cure you with that medicine, you pray, but it's even more expensive."</sup></p>
<p id="L15"><br></p>
<p id="L16">"Oh, by the way, I thought you also prayed."<br><sup>「ああ、そういえば祈祷もするんでしたっけ」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, come to think of it, do you pray?"</sup></p>
<p id="L17"><br></p>
<p id="L18">In this world, if you suffer from any kind of illness, the first thing you can do is try to treat it with medicines that you can get from stores and vendors in the city.<br><sup>こちらの世界では何らかの病気に罹った場合、まずは街なかの商店や行商人から手に入れられる薬で治療を試みる。</sup><br><sup>In this world, if you have any disease, you first try to treat it with medicine that you can get from shops and peddlers in the city.</sup></p>
<p id="L19">The medicines used range from the relatively easy to obtain, such as seawater (laxative) and miyagi milk (stomachic), to the more difficult to obtain, such as infusions of precious herbs.<br><sup>使う薬は海水（下剤）やミャギの乳（胃薬）といった比較的手に入りやすいものから、貴重な薬草を煎じたやや手に入りにくいものまで様々だ。</sup><br><sup>The medicines used range from relatively easy to obtain, such as seawater (diarrheal) and myagi's milk (stomach medicine), to slightly difficult to obtain.</sup></p>
<p id="L20">Naturally, the former is inexpensive and the latter is expensive.<br><sup>当然、前者は安価で後者は高価である。</sup><br><sup>Naturally, the former is cheap and the latter is expensive.</sup></p>
<p id="L21">If that doesn't heal you, you will have to resort to very expensive concoctions made by sorcerers and prayers.<br><sup>それでも治癒しない場合は、呪術師が作った非常に高価な調合薬や祈祷に頼るしかない。</sup><br><sup>If this doesn't work, we have to rely on expensive preparations and prayers made by magicians.</sup></p>
<p id="L22"><br></p>
<p id="L23">"By the way, how much does one prayer cost?　Is it about a thousand ars (the starting salary of a new soldier)?"<br><sup>「ちなみにですが、祈祷１回でどれくらいするんです？　１０００アル（新米兵士の初任給）くらいですか？」</sup><br><sup>"By the way, how much do you do in one prayer?"About 1,000 als (start salary for new recruits)?</sup></p>
<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25">"No, it varies from region to region, but those intended to cure disease cost at least five times that."<br><sup>「いえ、地域によっても異なりますが、病の治癒を目的としたものは最低でもそれの５倍はします」</sup><br><sup>"No, it depends on the region, but at least five times as much is meant to cure the disease."</sup></p>
<p id="L26"><br></p>
<p id="L27">"It's too expensive!　Does that really work?"<br><sup>「高っ！？　本当に効くんですかそれ！？」</sup><br><sup>"It's expensive!? Does it really work?"</sup></p>
<p id="L28"><br></p>
<p id="L29">"As long as the disease is not too serious, it can be cured or alleviated if it is done again and again. For those who are too weak and unconscious to take medicine, prayer is the last resort."<br><sup>「よほどの難病でない限り、何度も継続して行えば完治もしくは症状を緩和することはできるようです。弱りすぎて意識を失っていて、薬を飲むこともできないような者は祈祷が最後の頼みの綱ですね」</sup><br><sup>"As long as it's not a very incurable disease, it seems that you can cure it completely or relieve the symptoms by continuing to do it over and over again and again.Prayer is the last resort for those who are too weak to take medicine."</sup></p>
<p id="L30"><br></p>
<p id="L31">Kazuyoshi, who is used to modern medicine, is quite skeptical about prayer, but it seems to be effective in this world.<br><sup>現代医療に慣れきっている一良は祈祷というものにかなり懐疑的だが、この世界では実際に効果があるらしい。</sup><br><sup>Ichira, who is used to modern medicine, is quite skeptical about prayer, but it seems to be effective in this world.</sup></p>
<p id="L32">I was quite curious as to what kind of prayer would be so effective.<br><sup>それほど効力を発揮する祈祷とはいったいどんなものなのかと、かなり気になるところだ。</sup><br><sup>I'm quite curious about what it is like to have such an effective prayer.</sup></p>
<p id="L33"><br></p>
<p id="L34">"Prayer is praying to God, right?"<br><sup>「祈祷って、神様にお祈りするんですよね？」</sup><br><sup>"Praying means praying to God, right?"</sup></p>
<p id="L35"><br></p>
<p id="L36">"I don't know the details of the prayers performed by the sorcerer, but I believe they include not only the gods but also the spirits.<br><sup>「呪術師の行う祈祷の詳細は分かりませんが、祈りを捧げる対象は神だけでなく精霊も含まれると思います」</sup><br><sup>"I don't know the details of the magician's prayers, but I think not only God but also spirits are the targets of prayer."</sup></p>
<p id="L37"><br></p>
<p id="L38">"Hmmm, so you can cure diseases just by praying at ......?"<br><sup>「ふむ……で、祈りを捧げるだけで病気が治ったりするわけですか」</sup><br><sup>"Well... and can you cure your illness just by praying?"</sup></p>
<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">"Yes. However, the prayers of the sorcerers seem to be special, and their effects are far different from those offered by people like us.<br><sup>「ええ。ただ、呪術師の祈りは特殊なようで、我々のような者が捧げるものとは効果が段違いなんです」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, but the magician's prayers seem special, and they are far from what we offer."</sup></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42">"Isaac, have you ever prayed to a god or spirit and gotten their blessing or something?"<br><sup>「アイザックさんも神や精霊に祈りを捧げて、その加護か何かを得たことはあるんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Have you ever prayed to God or to the Spirit and obtained his protection or something?"</sup></p>
<p id="L43"><br></p>
<p id="L44">Isaac nodded as a matter of course to Kazura, who asked with interest.<br><sup>興味深げに尋ねる一良に、アイザックは当然のように頷いた。</sup><br><sup>Isaac nodded naturally to Ichira, who asked him interestingly.</sup></p>
<p id="L45"><br></p>
<p id="L46">"Of course I have. In the last battle, I prayed to Ormashiro-sama for blessings of courage and vitality after each battle."<br><sup>「もちろんあります。先の戦では戦闘の度にオルマシオール様に祈りを捧げて、勇気と活力の加護を授けていただきました」</sup><br><sup>"Of course I do.In the last battle, I prayed to Mr. Olmasiol every time I fought, and he gave me courage and vitality."</sup></p>
<p id="L47"><br></p>
<p id="L48">"Oh, I see. What is Ormusiol-sama's blessing like in terms of experience?"<br><sup>「へえ、そうなんですか。オルマシオール様の加護って、体感的にどういったものなんです？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, is that so?What is the protection of Mr. Omarshior like in terms of experience?"</sup></p>
<p id="L49"><br></p>
<p id="L50">"Yes, ...... even in the face of an enemy army charging at you, the feeling of fear or the desire to flee completely disappears. I feel like I'm dying for my people and my friends. ...... I'm sorry, I can't express it well.<br><sup>「そうですね……突撃してくる敵の軍勢を前にしても、怖いとか逃げ出したいといった気持ちがまったくなくなって、身体の奥底から力が漲ってきますね。民や仲間のためならここで死んでも本望だという、熱の塊のような衝動が湧き上がってくるというか……すみません、上手く表現できないです」</sup><br><sup>"Well... in the face of the enemy's army charging at me, I don't feel scared or want to run away at all, and I feel full of strength from the depths of my body.I'm sorry, I can't express myself well, even if I die here for the sake of my people and friends."</sup></p>
<p id="L51"><br></p>
<p id="L52">"Oh, really?"<br><sup>「そ、そうですか」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, is that so?"</sup></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54">It seemed to me that Isaac's own willpower had some influence, but if he thought it was the power of blessings from prayer, then that was fine.<br><sup>何やら多分にアイザック本人の意志の力が影響しているようにも感じられるが、本人が祈りによる加護の力だと思っているのならそれでいいのだろう。</sup><br><sup>It seems that Isaac's willpower has a lot to do with it, but if he thinks it's the power of prayer protection, that's all right.</sup></p>
<p id="L55"><br></p>
<p id="L56">"I know you're quite busy with your fertility prayers.　I'm sure you're quite busy praying for a good harvest."<br><sup>「カズラ様は願いを受けた際は、どのようなさじ加減で加護を与えているのですか？　豊穣の祈りなどでかなりお忙しいかと思いますが」</sup><br><sup>"When Kazura-sama receives his wish, how do you provide protection?I'm sure you're very busy praying for fertility."</sup></p>
<p id="L57"><br></p>
<p id="L58">"No, no, I don't know. I don't know, it's not something you do consciously. ......"<br><sup>「い、いやあ、どうだったかな。そういうのってあんまり意識してやるものでもないっていうか何というか……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, well, I don't know.That's not something you should be very conscious of, or what should I say?"</sup></p>
<p id="L59"><br></p>
<p id="L60">Isaac asked with clear eyes that didn't have a single doubt in them, and Kazuyoshi swept his gaze to answer.<br><sup>疑い一つ持たない澄んだ瞳で尋ねてくるアイザックに、一良は視線を泳がせて答える。</sup><br><sup>When Isaac asks with clear eyes without a doubt, Ichira glances back.</sup></p>
<p id="L61">Isaac then nodded deeply with a look of conviction for some reason.<br><sup>すると、アイザックは何故か納得したような表情で深く頷いた。</sup><br><sup>Then Isaac nodded deeply, looking convinced for some reason.</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63">"I see. I see. The accumulation of one's daily deeds and one's own destiny are also factors, and Kazura-sama does not give each blessing after careful consideration. Is it possible that you leave the blessings of prayer to the spirits of the earth?<br><sup>「なるほど。日頃の行いの積み重ねや本人の<ruby><rb>運命</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>さだめ</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>もありますし、一つ一つカズラ様が熟慮して加護を与えるといったものではないのですね。もしかして、祈りの加護は大地の精霊に任せているのですか？」</sup><br><sup>"I see. There are accumulations of daily conduct and the fate of the person, and Kazura-sama doesn't give protection one by one.Do you, by any chance, leave the protection of prayer to the Spirit of the Earth?"</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">"Oh, yeah, ...... that's right, ...... leave it to me, ......?"<br><sup>「ああ、うん……そうですね……任せっぱなしですかね……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, yes... well... do you leave it to me..."</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">As Kazuyoshi was answering guiltily, the door to the room opened and Baretta came in.<br><sup>一良が後ろめたそうに答えていると、部屋の扉が開いてバレッタが入ってきた。</sup><br><sup>Ichira was answering in a guilty manner when the door of the room opened and Valletta entered.</sup></p>
<p id="L68">When Baretta noticed Isaac's appearance, she hurriedly bowed her head and greeted him.<br><sup>バレッタはアイザックの姿に気付くと、慌ててぺこりと頭を下げて挨拶をした。</sup><br><sup>When Valletta saw Isaac, she bowed her head in a hurry.</sup></p>
<p id="L69"><br></p>
<p id="L70">"I'm sorry I'm late. ...... Um, the food is ready at ......."<br><sup>「ごめんなさい、遅くなっちゃいました……あの、食事の仕度は……」</sup><br><sup>"I'm sorry, I'm late... you know, the preparation of the meal..."</sup></p>
<p id="L71"><br></p>
<p id="L72">"Marie came by a little while ago and brought the ingredients, so it's okay. I told her that Baretta was out of town on business."<br><sup>「少し前にマリーさんが来て材料を持っていったんで大丈夫です。バレッタさんは仕事で外に出てるって伝えてありますから」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Marie came and took the ingredients a while ago, so it's all right.Mr. Valletta told me that he was out on business."</sup></p>
<p id="L73"><br></p>
<p id="L74">"Well, I'm going to go help out now. Do you have anything left to do? ......"<br><sup>「じゃあ、今から手伝いに行ってきますね。やること残ってるかな……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I'll go and help you now.I wonder if there's anything left to do..."</sup></p>
<p id="L75"><br></p>
<p id="L76">"Oh, Ms. Valletta.<br><sup>「あ、バレッタさん」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, Mr. Valletta,"</sup></p>
<p id="L77"><br></p>
<p id="L78">"Yes?"<br><sup>「はい？」</sup><br><sup>"What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L79"><br></p>
<p id="L80">When Ichira stopped her, Baretta turned around with her hand on the doorknob.<br><sup>一良に呼び止められ、バレッタはドアノブに手をかけたまま振り返った。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira stopped her, Valletta turned around with her hand on the doorknob.</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">"It's Marie, but she hasn't been feeling well since this morning. So I was wondering if you could do me a favor."<br><sup>「マリーさんなんですが、今朝からずっと元気がないみたいなんです。それで、ちょっとお願いがあって」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Marie, you haven't been feeling well since this morning.And I have a favor to ask of you."</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">At these words, Baretta took her hand off the doorknob and turned to Kazura.<br><sup>その言葉に、バレッタはドアノブから手を離して一良に向き直った。</sup><br><sup>At that remark, Valletta took her hand off the doorknob and turned to Ichira.</sup></p>
<p id="L85"><br></p>
<p id="L86">"I tried to talk to her this morning, but she didn't seem to be comfortable talking to me, so she didn't say anything. So I was hoping that Valletta and Eira would take care of her."<br><sup>「今朝声をかけてみたんですけど、やっぱり私には話しづらいようで何も言ってくれなかったんです。それで、バレッタさんやエイラさんに彼女のことを気にかけてもらえたらなって」</sup><br><sup>"I tried to talk to him this morning, but he didn't say anything because it seemed difficult for me to talk.And I wish Valletta and Ayla would take care of her."</sup></p>
<p id="L87"><br></p>
<p id="L88">"Yes, I also noticed something strange when we were cooking together this morning. ......"<br><sup>「はい、私も今朝一緒に料理してる時に様子が変だなって……」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I felt strange when we were cooking together this morning..."</sup></p>
<p id="L89"><br></p>
<p id="L90">"Oh, you noticed. I thought she might get better if I gave her some time, but she still looked gloomy when I saw her earlier, so I was curious. I'm sorry, but I want you to keep an eye on her."<br><sup>「あ、気付いてましたか。時間を置けば元気になるかなとも思ったんですが、さっき見た時もまだ暗い顔をしていたので気になって。すみませんが、彼女のこと気にかけておいて欲しいんです」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, did you notice?I thought I'd feel better if I took time, but when I saw him earlier, he still looked dark, so I was curious.I'm sorry, but I want you to take care of her."</sup></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">"Yes, it's fine. I'll talk to Eira about it later. I think Eira-san will be easier to talk to than I am, Marie-chan.<br><sup>「はい、大丈夫です。後でエイラさんにも相談しておきますね。マリーちゃんも、私よりエイラさんのほうが話しやすいと思いますから」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, it'sir.I'll talk to Ayla later.I think it's easier for Marie to talk to Ayla than to talk to me."</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94">"Excuse me, please."<br><sup>「すみません、よろしくお願いします」</sup><br><sup>"I'm sorry, thank you for your cooperation."</sup></p>
<p id="L95"><br></p>
<p id="L96">Baretta smiled gently at Kazuyoshi, who said he was sorry, and left the room.<br><sup>すまなそうに言う一良にバレッタは優しく微笑むと、部屋を出て行った。</sup><br><sup>Valletta smiled gently at Ichira, who said she was sorry, and left the room.</sup></p>
<p id="L97">Isaac turned to face Ichiran as the door closed.<br><sup>アイザックは扉が閉まると、一良に顔を向けた。</sup><br><sup>Isaac turned to Ichira when the door closed.</sup></p>
<p id="L98"><br></p>
<p id="L99">"Now, if you'll excuse me as well. Are you sure you want to visit the Sorcerer's Guild's herb garden as planned?"<br><sup>「では、私も失礼いたします。呪術師組合の薬草園の見学は予定どおりでよろしいでしょうか？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, excuse me, too.Is it all right if I visit the herb garden of the sorcerer's union on schedule?"</sup></p>
<p id="L100"><br></p>
<p id="L101">"Please do. I'm going to ask you to prepare the medicine on the day, so please arrange for someone who is in a position to make such a decision to be present.<br><sup>「お願いします。当日は薬の調合依頼もしてしまうつもりなので、そういった判断を下せる立場のかたに立ち会ってもらえるように手配してください」</sup><br><sup>"I beg of course.I'm going to ask you to prepare the medicine on the day, so please arrange for someone who can make such a decision."</sup></p>
<p id="L102"><br></p>
<p id="L103">"Yes, sir."<br><sup>「かしこまりました」</sup><br><sup>"Very well,"</sup></p>
<p id="L104"><br></p>
<p id="L105">Isaac bowed deeply and left the room.<br><sup>アイザックは深々と頭を下げ、部屋を出て行った。</sup><br><sup>Isaac bowed deeply and left the room.</sup></p>
<p id="L106">Kazuyoshi looked away and leaned his back against the back of the chair.<br><sup>一良はその背を見送り、椅子の背もたれに背を預けた。</sup><br><sup>Ichira saw him off and laid his back on the back of the chair.</sup></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">"I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'm not the only one.<br><sup>「うーん、やっぱりハベルさんにも相談しておいたほうがいいのかな……でも、それだとあの２人揉めそうだしなぁ」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I guess I should consult with Mr. Hubbell... but I think they'll have a fight."</sup></p>
<p id="L109"><br></p>
<p id="L110">When I see Marie looking so exhausted, I want to do something to help her, but when it comes to family issues, I hesitate to step in.<br><sup>酷く憔悴した様子のマリーを見ると何かと手を出したくなってしまうが、家族間の問題となると踏み込むのに躊躇してしまう。</sup><br><sup>When I see Marie looking very haggard, I want to touch her, but when it comes to family problems, I hesitate to step in.</sup></p>
<p id="L111">But if Marie is being treated badly by Arondo, I want to help her.<br><sup>だが、マリーがアロンドから酷い扱いを受けているというのなら助けてやりたい。</sup><br><sup>But if Marie is being treated badly by Alond, I'd like to help her.</sup></p>
<p id="L112">It would be best if they could solve the problem themselves, but from the looks of things so far, that seemed unlikely.<br><sup>当人たちで解決してくれればそれが一番なのだが、今までの様子を見る限りそれは難しいように思えた。</sup><br><sup>It would be best if they could solve it themselves, but from what they have done so far, it seemed difficult.</sup></p>
<p id="L113"><br></p>
<p id="L114">"I'm not sure if it's a good idea for me to complain directly to Mr. Alondo. But it's not going to solve the root of the problem, it might even make it worse. ......<br><sup>「俺からアロンドさんに直接苦情を入れるのも一つの手か。でも、根本的な解決にはならないどころか、下手すりゃ悪化させるかもしれないしなぁ……」</sup><br><sup>"Is it one way to complain directly to Mr. Alonde?"But it's not a fundamental solution, but if you're not good at it, you might make it worse..."</sup></p>
<p id="L115"><br></p>
<p id="L116">He wondered for a moment what he should do, and in the end he postponed his decision and looked down at the report again.<br><sup>どうしたものかとひとしきり悩み、結局は結論を先延ばしにして再び報告書に目を落とすのだった。</sup><br><sup>He hesitated for a while about what to do, and eventually postponed his conclusion and looked down on the report again.</sup></p>
<p id="L117"><br></p>
<p id="L118"><br></p>
<p id="L119"><br></p>
<p id="L120">A few mornings later.<br><sup>数日後の朝。</sup><br><sup>A few days later, in the morning.</sup></p>
<p id="L121">Ichiro, accompanied by Baretta, Lise, and Isaac, came by carriage to the gates of the Sorcerer's Guild in the northern part of Isteria.<br><sup>一良はバレッタとリーゼ、それにアイザックを伴って、馬車でイステリアの北部にある呪術師組合の門の前にやってきた。</sup><br><sup>Ichira, accompanied by Valletta and Liese, and Isaac, came in a carriage to the gate of the sorcerer's union in the north of Isteria.</sup></p>
<p id="L122">I got out of the carriage and looked up at the high walls and closed gates, which must have been three meters high.<br><sup>馬車を降り、３メートルはあろうかという高い<ruby><rb>塀</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>へい</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>と閉じられた門を見上げる。</sup><br><sup>I got out of the carriage and looked up at the high wall and the closed gate, which was three meters long.</sup></p>
<p id="L123">A wall surrounds the site, making it impossible to see inside the building from the outside.<br><sup>塀は敷地をぐるっと囲んでおり、外から建物の中を窺うことはできない。</sup><br><sup>The walls surrounded the site and could not be seen from the outside.</sup></p>
<p id="L124">Isaac, who had been leading the ride, dismounted from the rata and knocked on the closed gate.<br><sup>騎乗して先導していたアイザックはラタから降りると、閉じられている門を叩いた。</sup><br><sup>Isaac, who was riding and leading, got out of Rata and knocked on the closed gate.</sup></p>
<p id="L125">Immediately, an old, robed man appeared from within.<br><sup>するとすぐに、中からローブを纏った年老いた男が現れた。</sup><br><sup>Soon an old man in a robe appeared from inside.</sup></p>
<p id="L126"><br></p>
<p id="L127">"Dear Isaac, we have been expecting you. I didn't know you were with us, Lise. ......"<br><sup>「アイザック様、お待ちしておりました。リーゼ様もご一緒とは……」</sup><br><sup>"I have been waiting for you, Mr. Isaac.Mr. Liese, I can't believe you're with me..."</sup></p>
<p id="L128"><br></p>

<p id="L190">"Hmm, so this is how you grow them. It looks like there are a lot of gaps.<br><sup>「ふむ、こうやって育ててるんですか。ずいぶん隙間があるように見えますけど、これはどうしてです？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's how you raise them.There seems to be a lot of gaps, but why is this?"</sup></p>
<p id="L191"><br></p>
<p id="L192">"Medicinal plants don't like to be grouped together, so even if they are of the same species, they will stop growing if they are close together.

<p id="L195"><br></p>
<p id="L196">"Of course we do it.

<p id="L197"><br></p>
<p id="L198">Hearing this, Kazuyoshi tilted his head, "Oh? He tilted his head.<br><sup>それを聞き、一良は「おや？」と首を傾げた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira heard that, he tilted his head and said, "Oh, my God?"</sup></p>
<p id="L199"><br></p>
<p id="L200">"What, are you burning the bones?"<br><sup>「えっ、骨を焼いてるんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, are you burning your bones?"</sup></p>
<p id="L201"><br></p>
<p id="L202">"Yes. I'm roasting it once to purify it. We can't offer them to Mr. Gracior with their flesh and skin stuck to them, so we have to remove them as well.<br><sup>「はい。浄化の意味も込めて、一旦焼いております。肉や皮がへばりついているままグレイシオール様に捧げるわけにはいかないので、それを取る意味もありますが」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I'm baking it once to purify it.I can't dedicate the meat and skin to Mr. Graciol, so it's meaningful to take it."</sup></p>
<p id="L203"><br></p>

<p id="L205"><br></p>
<p id="L206">"No, I do not. I try to spread it as often as possible to strengthen the power of the blessing.<br><sup>「いえ。加護の力を強めるために、可能な限りこまめに撒くようにしていますね」</sup><br><sup>"No, I try to sprinkle it as often as possible to strengthen the power of protection."</sup></p>
<p id="L207"><br></p>
<p id="L208">Apparently, they were unknowingly making and spreading a kind of fertilizer made by burning bones at high temperatures.<br><sup>どうやら、彼らは知らず知らずのうちに骨肥（こっぴ・骨を高温で焼いて作る肥料）のようなものを作って撒いていたようだ。</sup><br><sup>It seems that they unwittingly made and sprinkled bone manure.</sup></p>

<p id="L216">Kazuyoshi didn't seem particularly concerned and nodded, "I see.<br><sup>一良は特に気にした様子もなく、「そうですか」と頷く。</sup><br><sup>Ichira nods, "Is that so?" without showing any particular concern.</sup></p>
<p id="L217"><br></p>
<p id="L218">"Would it be different growing up if I did or did not do that spell?"<br><sup>「そのおまじないをするのとしないのとでは育ち方が違いますかね？」</sup><br><sup>"Is there any difference between doing that magic and not doing it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L219"><br></p>

<p id="L233"><br></p>
<p id="L234">When Kazuyoshi answered, the man's expression became blatantly scandalous.<br><sup>一良が答えると、男はあからさまにうさんくさそうな表情になった。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira replied, the man looked plainly suspicious.</sup></p>
<p id="L235"><br></p>

<p id="L240">"Yeah, some of them are the same.<br><sup>「ええ、同じものもありますよ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, they are the same,"</sup></p>

<p id="L244">"I'm afraid I can't tell you about that.<br><sup>「それはちょっとお教えするわけにはいかないですね」</sup><br><sup>"I can't tell you a little about that,"</sup></p>
<p id="L245"><br></p>
<p id="L246">When Kazuyoshi said this, the man's expression changed to something even more grim.<br><sup>一良が言うと、男の表情はさらに険しいものへと変化した。</sup><br><sup>As Ichira said, the man's expression turned even more grim.</sup></p>

<p id="L249">"Oh, no, it's true, okay?　Just recently, we really succeeded in increasing the production of medicinal herbs.

<p id="L285">"...... Hmm."<br><sup>「……ふむ」</sup><br><sup>"... well,"</sup></p>
<p id="L286"><br></p>
<p id="L287">When Kazuyoshi answered, the man crossed his arms and looked thoughtful.<br><sup>一良が答えると、男は腕を組んで思案するような表情になった。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira answered, the man folded his arms and looked worried.</sup></p>
<p id="L288">Kazuyoshi looked at him suspiciously.<br><sup>その様子を、一良は怪訝そうに見つめる。</sup><br><sup>Ichira looks at the situation suspiciously.</sup></p>
<p id="L289"><br></p>
<p id="L290">"No, I'm sorry. I understand what you're saying. And may I ask what is the purpose of the medicine you are buying?"<br><sup>「いや、失敬。話は分かりました。それと、そちらがお買い求めになる薬の用途をお伺いしてもよろしいですか？」</sup><br><sup>"No, excuse me. I understand.And may I ask you what the use of the medicine you will buy?"</sup></p>
<p id="L291"><br></p>
<p id="L292">"It was decided that the military should have some stock of medicines so that they would not be in trouble in case of emergency. The policy is to purchase and update medicines on a regular basis and dispose of old ones. Of course, under your guidance, of course."<br><sup>「有事の際に困らないように、軍でもある程度取り置きしておこうということになりまして。薬は定期的に購入して新しいものに更新して、古い薬は処分する方針です。もちろん、そちらの指導の下で、ですが」</sup><br><sup>"The army has decided to keep it to a certain extent so that it will not be in trouble in case of emergency.We plan to buy medicines regularly, update them with new ones, and dispose of old ones.Of course, under your guidance."</sup></p>
<p id="L293"><br></p>
<p id="L294">"I see. That's a good idea. That's a good idea. We wouldn't be able to prepare for a sudden supply of medicine if we were suddenly asked to send a large amount of it, so that would be a relief.<br><sup>「なるほど、それはいいお考えですね。我々もいきなり大量に薬を寄越せと言われても急には準備できませんので、それであれば安心できます」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's a good idea.Even if we are suddenly asked to send a large amount of medicine, we cannot prepare it all of a sudden, so we can be relieved."</sup></p>
<p id="L295"><br></p>
<p id="L296">"Yes. And now that we've succeeded in increasing the production of medicinal herbs, we've decided to ask for the cooperation of the sorcerer's guild to lower the price of medicines. Can you help us in any way?"<br><sup>「ええ。それで、折りよく薬草の増産にも成功したので、呪術師組合に協力してもらってもっと薬の価格を下げられないかという話になったんです。何とか協力していただけませんか？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes. So, I succeeded in increasing the production of herbs, so I was asked if I could get the help of the sorcerer's union to lower the price of medicine further.Would you please help me somehow?"</sup></p>
<p id="L297"><br></p>
<p id="L298">"If you can provide us with a stable supply of medicinal herbs, of course we can. However, since it is very difficult to prepare medicines, we cannot promise that we will be able to lower the price enough to satisfy you. Please understand that.<br><sup>「材料の薬草を安定供給していただけるというのなら、もちろん可能です。ただ、なにぶん薬の調合は非常に難しく、ご納得いただけるほどに価格を下げることができるかはお約束できません。そこはご理解を」</sup><br><sup>"Of course it is possible if you can provide us with a stable supply of herbs.However, the preparation of the medicine is somewhat difficult and I can't promise you that we can lower the price to your satisfaction.Please understand that."</sup></p>
<p id="L299"><br></p>
<p id="L300">"Yes, that's fine. We'll discuss the details of the amount later."<br><sup>「ええ、それは大丈夫です。金額の細かい取り決めはまた後ほど相談しましょう」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, that's all right.Let's discuss the details of the amount later."</sup></p>
<p id="L301"><br></p>
<p id="L302">When Kazuyoshi said this, the man pretended to think for a moment.<br><sup>一良がそう言うと、男は少し考えるような素振りをした。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira said so, the man pretended to think a little.</sup></p>
<p id="L303"><br></p>
<p id="L304">"I'd like to ask ......, how much medicine would you be willing to buy from House Istair?"<br><sup>「……お尋ねしたいのですが、イステール家に買い取っていただける薬の量はどのくらいになりますか？」</sup><br><sup>"... I'd like to ask you, how much medicine will the Istair family buy?"</sup></p>
<p id="L305"><br></p>
<p id="L306">"I don't know for sure yet, but it's not a small amount.<br><sup>「まだはっきりとは分かりませんが、けっして少ない量ではないですよ」</sup><br><sup>"I'm not sure yet, but it's not a small amount."</sup></p>
<p id="L307"><br></p>
<p id="L308">There is another reason why we buy expensive drugs from them on a regular basis, and that is to make it palatable to them as well.<br><sup>高価な薬を定期的に彼らから購入する理由はもう１つ、彼らに対しても旨みを持たせるという目的がある。</sup><br><sup>Another reason to regularly buy expensive medicines from them is to make them taste good.</sup></p>
<p id="L309">In addition to providing them with a steady supply of medicinal herbs, the Istair family plans to sell them at low prices in the form of commonly known decoctions.<br><sup>材料である薬草は彼らに安定供給するほかにも、一般的に知られている煎じ薬などにしてイステール家が安価に販売する予定だ。</sup><br><sup>In addition to supplying them with herbs, the Istair family plans to sell them cheaply using commonly known decoction drugs.</sup></p>
<p id="L310">Of course, the Sorcerer's Guild also sells those medicines, and if the Istair family were to sell them on a large scale, they would effectively become business enemies.<br><sup>もちろん呪術師組合もそれらの薬は販売しており、イステール家が大々的にそれらを売り出すと実質的に商売敵となってしまう。</sup><br><sup>Of course, the sorcerer's association also sells these drugs, and if the Istair family sells them on a large scale, they become substantial business enemies.</sup></p>
<p id="L311">So, by supplying them with medicinal herbs at a low price and making a contract with them to purchase expensive medicines on a regular basis, we can make them feel good about themselves and avoid confrontation.<br><sup>そこで、彼らにも薬草を安く供給し、かつ高額な薬を定期的に購入する契約を交わすことで、相手に対して旨みを持たせて対立を避けるのだ。</sup><br><sup>Therefore, by providing them with herbs at a low price and signing contracts to buy expensive medicines regularly, they can avoid conflicts with each other.</sup></p>
<p id="L312">From the looks of it, their production of medicinal herbs is much less efficient than Ichirō's, so this offer should be more beneficial to them.<br><sup>見たところ彼らの薬草生産は一良たちに比べてかなり効率が悪そうなので、この申し出は相手にとって旨みのほうが大きいはずだ。</sup><br><sup>Their herbal production seems to be quite inefficient compared to Ichira's, so this offer should be more beneficial to the other party.</sup></p>
<p id="L313">There is a possibility that we will have a little trouble with the drug sales concessions, but we will have to make it work.<br><sup>薬販売の利権で少し揉めることになる可能性もあるが、そこは何とか上手くやるしかない。</sup><br><sup>There's a possibility that we'll have a little dispute over the rights to sell drugs, but we have to do something about it.</sup></p>
<p id="L314"><br></p>
<p id="L315">"Oh yeah, ......."<br><sup>「そうですか……」</sup><br><sup>"Is that so?"</sup></p>
<p id="L316"><br></p>
<p id="L317">"What's the problem?<br><sup>「何か問題が？」</sup><br><sup>"What's the problem?"</sup></p>
<p id="L318"><br></p>
<p id="L319">"No, I have one suggestion: ......1. How about we take the herbs for the medicines to be delivered to you free of charge, and when we deliver the medicines to you, we deduct the cost of the materials and charge you a fee?<br><sup>「いえ……１つ提案があります。そちらに納める薬の分の薬草についてですが、我々が薬草を無償で受け取り、薬を納入する際に材料費を引いたうえで手数料をいただくというのはどうでしょうか」</sup><br><sup>"No... I have a suggestion.As for the herbs you pay for the medicines, how about we receive the herbs free of charge and deduct the material cost when we deliver the medicines?"</sup></p>
<p id="L320"><br></p>
<p id="L321">"You mean you give me the materials first, and the money is delivered at the end?"<br><sup>「材料を先に渡して、金銭の受け渡しは最後の納品時ってことですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Do you mean you give the ingredients first and hand over the money at the last delivery?"</sup></p>
<p id="L322"><br></p>
<p id="L323">"Yes. It takes a lot of herbs to refine the medicine. So, if we have to buy a huge amount of herbs for this purpose, the price we will have to pay will be very high.<br><sup>「はい。薬の精製にはかなりの量の薬草を使います。なので、そのために膨大な量の薬草を買い取るとなると、先に我々が支払う金額も大変なものになってしまいますので」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, we use quite a lot of herbs to purify the medicine.Therefore, if we buy a huge amount of herbs for that purpose, the amount of money we pay in advance will be huge."</sup></p>
<p id="L324"><br></p>
<p id="L325">"I see. ......"<br><sup>「なるほど……」</sup><br><sup>"I see..."</sup></p>
<p id="L326"><br></p>
<p id="L327">Kazuyoshi was about to nod his head in agreement when he noticed Baretta waving her hand behind the man.<br><sup>一良が納得して頷きかかった時、男の背後でバレッタがぶんぶんと手を振っているのに気がついた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira nodded convincingly, he noticed Valletta waving his hand behind the man.</sup></p>
<p id="L328">Baretta made a batsuit with her hand and lip-synced, "No! she pleaded desperately.<br><sup>バレッタは手でバツを作り、口パクで「ダメです！」と必死に訴えている。</sup><br><sup>Valletta makes a cut with her hands and lip-syncs and pleads desperately, "No!"</sup></p>
<p id="L329">For a moment, Kazuyoshi thought about it, and then he realized.<br><sup>一瞬一良は考え、はっとした。</sup><br><sup>For a moment Kazuyoshi thought and was surprised.</sup></p>
<p id="L330"><br></p>
<p id="L331">"What can I do for you?"<br><sup>「どうかなされましたか？」</sup><br><sup>"What's the matter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L332"><br></p>
<p id="L333">"No, no, no. ...... Um, can we still do business as usual?　You buy the herbs, and we buy the finished medicine.<br><sup>「い、いえ……あの、やはり通常どおりの取引にしてもらえませんか？　そちらに薬草を買い取ってもらって、出来上がった薬を我々が購入するってかたちで」</sup><br><sup>"No, no... well, could you make it a normal transaction?"In the form of having them buy you herbs and we'll buy you the finished medicine."</sup></p>
<p id="L334"><br></p>
<p id="L335">"We are not rich enough to buy a large amount of herbs at once. We are not wealthy enough to buy a large amount of medicinal herbs at once. ......"<br><sup>「そう申されましても。我々も大量の薬草を一度に買い取れるほどに裕福なわけでもないので……」</sup><br><sup>"That's not what you said.We are not rich enough to buy large quantities of herbs at once."</sup></p>
<p id="L336"><br></p>
<p id="L337">Aside from the wealthy crap, to the casual observer, there seems to be nothing wrong with the man's proposal.<br><sup>裕福のくだりはともかくとして、傍目に聞けば男の提案には何の問題もないように感じられる。</sup><br><sup>Apart from the rich, it seems that there is nothing wrong with the man's proposal.</sup></p>
<p id="L338">But when you think about it, it's a pretty dangerous proposition for Kazura and the others.<br><sup>だが、よく考えると一良たちにとってはかなり危険な提案なのだ。</sup><br><sup>On reflection, however, it is a very dangerous proposal for Ichira and others.</sup></p>
<p id="L339"><br></p>
<p id="L340">"Hmmm, ......, why don't we decide to trade less in the beginning and just trade as usual?　That won't be a problem, will it?"<br><sup>「うーん……初めのうちは取引量を少なめにするってことにして、通常どおりの取引にしませんか？　それなら問題ないでしょう？」</sup><br><sup>"Well... why don't we reduce the volume of transactions at first and make it the usual transaction?"Then there's no problem, is there?"</sup></p>
<p id="L341"><br></p>
<p id="L342">The man nodded reluctantly as Ichiran said.<br><sup>一良が言うと、男は渋々といった様子で頷いた。</sup><br><sup>Ichira said, and the man nodded reluctantly.</sup></p>
<p id="L343">So, we settled the matter once and for all, and decided to sign the contract at a later date.<br><sup>そうして一旦話はまとまり、本契約は後日改めて、ということになった。</sup><br><sup>Thus, the agreement was reached and this agreement was to be renewed at a later date.</sup></p>
<p id="L344">As the man walked him outside the gate, Kazuyoshi pulled out a small flower pot from a parked carriage.<br><sup>門の外まで男に送ってもらったところで、一良は停めてあった馬車の中から小ぶりな植木鉢を引っ張り出した。</sup><br><sup>As he was escorted out of the gate, Ichira pulled a small flowerpot out of the parked carriage.</sup></p>
<p id="L345">The pots were filled with several medicinal herbs of different types, all of which had lush leaves and thick stems.<br><sup>鉢には種類の違う薬草が数本植えられていて、そのどれもが青々とした葉や太い茎を持っている。</sup><br><sup>Several herbs of different kinds are planted in the pots, all of which have green leaves and thick stems.</sup></p>
<p id="L346">The soil in the flowerpots has already been replaced with regular soil.<br><sup>植木鉢の土は、普通のものに入れ替え済みだ。</sup><br><sup>The soil in the flowerpot has been replaced with ordinary soil.</sup></p>
<p id="L347"><br></p>
<p id="L348">"These are the medicinal herbs grown by the Istair family that I mentioned earlier. I would be happy to show them to you when we discuss this at the union."<br><sup>「先ほどお話した、イステール家で栽培している薬草です。組合での協議の際に、皆さんにお見せいただければと思います」</sup><br><sup>"It's a medicinal herb grown by the Istair family that I mentioned earlier.I would like you to show it to everyone during the consultation at the union."</sup></p>
<p id="L349"><br></p>
<p id="L350">When Ichira handed the man the bowl, he stared at it sullenly.<br><sup>一良が男に鉢を手渡すと、彼はそれをしげしげと見つめた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira handed the bowl to the man, he looked at it carefully.</sup></p>
<p id="L351">He looks a little surprised at the size of it.<br><sup>その大きさに少し驚いているように見える。</sup><br><sup>You look a little surprised at the size.</sup></p>
<p id="L352">So long," Kazuyoshi greeted, getting into the carriage and leaving the place.<br><sup>それでは、と一良は挨拶をし、馬車に乗り込むとその場を後にした。</sup><br><sup>Then Kazura said hello, got into the carriage and left.</sup></p>
<p id="L353"><br></p>
<p id="L354"><br></p>
<p id="L355"><br></p>
<p id="L356">"Thank you for stopping me earlier, Baretta-san. I was about to be taken in."<br><sup>「バレッタさん、さっきは止めてくれて助かりました。まんまと丸め込まれるところでしたよ」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Valletta, it was helpful of you to stop me a while ago.I almost fell for it."</sup></p>
<p id="L357"><br></p>
<p id="L358">As soon as they were in the carriage, Kazura thanked Baretta.<br><sup>馬車に乗ってすぐ、一良はバレッタに礼を言った。</sup><br><sup>As soon as he got into the carriage, Ichira thanked Valletta.</sup></p>
<p id="L359">Valletta smiled, "You're welcome.<br><sup>バレッタは「どういたしまして」と微笑んでいる。</sup><br><sup>Valletta smiles, "You're welcome."</sup></p>
<p id="L360"><br></p>
<p id="L361">"However, I was surprised that he tried to hook me in such a natural way. ...... I wonder how greedy he is.<br><sup>「しかし、あんなに自然なかたちで引っ掛けようとしてくるとは驚いたな……どんだけがめついんだか」</sup><br><sup>"But I'm surprised you're trying to hook me in such a natural way... how hard it is."</sup></p>
<p id="L362"><br></p>
<p id="L363">"Hey, hey, what was wrong with that proposal?　It sounded like a good idea with simplified transactions."<br><sup>「ねえねえ、あの提案の何がいけなかったの？　取引も簡略化されていい案に聞こえたんだけど」</sup><br><sup>"Hey, what didn't work out about that proposal?"The transaction was simplified and sounded like a good idea."</sup></p>
<p id="L364"><br></p>
<p id="L365">Lise said, a little frustrated, as if she didn't like the fact that she was the only one who didn't understand the conversation.<br><sup>自分だけ話が理解できていないのが気に食わないのか、少し不満そうにリーゼが言う。</sup><br><sup>Liese says a little dissatisfied if she doesn't like the fact that she's the only one who doesn't understand.</sup></p>
<p id="L366"><br></p>
<p id="L367">"No, they have a monopoly on the manufacturing method of medicine, right?　So, if we provide them with the materials for free, they'll say, 'We could only make this much medicine from these materials,' and we'll have to believe them.<br><sup>「いや、薬の製法って彼らが独占してるだろ？　だから、こっちが先に無償で材料提供ってかたちにすると、『この材料からはこれだけの薬しか作れませんでした』って言われたらそれを信じるしかないんだよ」</sup><br><sup>"No, they have a monopoly on the manufacturing process, don't they? So if we give them free ingredients first, they have no choice but to believe it when they say, 'We could only make this much medicine out of these ingredients.'"</sup></p>
<p id="L368"><br></p>
<p id="L369">Liese immediately, "Ah!" She clapped her hands.<br><sup>リーゼはすぐに、「ああ！」と手を打った。</sup><br><sup>Liese immediately clapped her hand.</sup></p>
<p id="L370"><br></p>
<p id="L371">"You mean they won't know if I say much less than the amount of medicine I can actually make?"<br><sup>「実際に作れる薬の量よりかなり少なめに言ってもばれないってことね？」</sup><br><sup>"You mean you can't find out much less than the actual amount of medicine you can make?"</sup></p>
<p id="L372"><br></p>
<p id="L373">"Yes, yes. It's not uncommon for a client to provide materials to a business partner free of charge for processing, so I didn't notice it at first. Watch out!<br><sup>「そうそう。発注元が取引先に材料を無償提供して加工を依頼するってのは珍しい話じゃないから、最初は気付かなかったんだ。危ない危ない」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I didn't notice it at first because it's not unusual for an orderer to provide materials to customers for free and request processing.It's dangerous."</sup></p>
<p id="L374"><br></p>
<p id="L375">However, if they do not do so and only pay a processing fee, the union, which has a monopoly on the manufacturing process, can cheat as much as they want.<br><sup>物の移動があるごとにきっちりお金のやり取りをして話を進めるのなら問題ないが、それをせずに加工の手数料だけを支払うかたちにしてしまうと製法を独占している組合側はいくらでも誤魔化しがきく。</sup><br><sup>There is no problem if we exchange money and proceed with the conversation every time there is a movement, but if we pay only the processing fee without doing so, the union, which monopolizes the manufacturing method, will be able to deceive as much as possible.</sup></p>
<p id="L376">If Baretta hadn't stopped me, I would have been able to put the story together in their favor.<br><sup>バレッタが止めてくれなければ、まんまと彼らの都合のいいように話を纏められていただろう。</sup><br><sup>If Valletta hadn't stopped us, we would have arranged the matter for their convenience.</sup></p>
<p id="L377"><br></p>
<p id="L378">"I think it's better to ask someone who's used to this kind of negotiation. I wonder if Mr. Arondo will be able to handle the Sorcerer's Guild."<br><sup>「やっぱり、こういった交渉ごとは慣れている人に頼んだほうがいいか。アロンドさんなら呪術師組合相手でも上手くやってくれるかな」</sup><br><sup>"After all, should we ask someone who is used to this kind of negotiation?I wonder if Mr. Alondo will do well against the sorcerer's union."</sup></p>
<p id="L379"><br></p>
<p id="L380">"Master Arondo, is it?"<br><sup>「アロンド様、ですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Alondo?"</sup></p>
<p id="L381"><br></p>
<p id="L382">Responding to the name, Baretta asked back.<br><sup>その名前に反応し、バレッタが聞き返した。</sup><br><sup>replied Valletta, responding to the name.</sup></p>
<p id="L383"><br></p>
<p id="L384">"Yes, he's very good at business. He has helped me a lot in the past, so I thought it would be safe to ask him to do the same for this project. I'm leaving most of the procurement and management of materials to him, so I'm sure Baretta-san will have opportunities to see him from time to time in the future.<br><sup>「ええ、彼って商売がすごく上手いんですよ。今までもかなり助けてもらってるんで、今回の件もお願いできれば安泰かなって。資材の調達や管理についても大部分は彼に任せているんで、今後はバレッタさんもちょこちょこ会う機会があると思いますよ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, he is a very good businessman.I've received a lot of help so far, so I wonder if it would be safe if I could ask you to do so this time goes by.I leave most of the procurement and management of the materials to him, so I think I'll have a chance to see Valletta from now on."</sup></p>
<p id="L385"><br></p>
<p id="L386">"Yes, I ran into him the other day at a carpenter's shop and he said hello.<br><sup>「はい、先日大工職人さんのところで偶然お会いして、これからよろしくって言われました」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I ran into a carpenter the other day and he said hello to me."</sup></p>

<p id="L389"><br></p>
<p id="L390">"Yes. He remembered my name and said he would take me home in his carriage. Because of what happened to Marie, I thought he would be a scary person, so I was a little surprised.<br><sup>「はい。名前も覚えてくださっていて、帰りも馬車で送っていくって言ってくださったんです。マリーちゃんのことがあったのでもっと怖い人なのかなって思ってたんで、ちょっと意外でした」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, he remembered my name, and he said he would take me home in a carriage.I was a little surprised because I thought Marie was a scarier person."</sup></p>
<p id="L391"><br></p>
<p id="L392">"Well, that house seems a bit complicated when it comes to her. ......

<p id="L395"><br></p>
