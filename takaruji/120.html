<p id="L1">A few days later, Kazuyoshi and Alondo were having lunch at a restaurant in the city.<br><sup>数日後の昼、一良はアロンドとともに、街なかの飲食店で食事をとっていた。</sup><br><sup>A few days later, Ichira and Alondo were eating at restaurants around town.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">As usual, Kazuyoshi is eating the lunch that Marie made for him, while Arondo is eating the food he ordered from the restaurant.<br><sup>いつものように一良はマリーが作ってくれたお弁当で、アロンドは店で注文した料理を食べている。</sup><br><sup>As usual, Ichira is eating the lunch box Marie made for him, and Alondo is eating the food he ordered at the restaurant.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">Earlier, Marie had been with him, but now he had her head down to Lise.<br><sup>先ほどまでマリーも一緒にいたのだが、今はリーゼの下に向かわせている。</sup><br><sup>Marie was with me until a while ago, but now I'm putting her under Liese.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">As soon as I told her that Arondo was coming, Marie's expression became very tense, so I made her leave her seat.<br><sup>というのも、アロンドが来ると伝えた途端にマリーが表情を強張らせたので、これはいかんと席を外させたのだ。</sup><br><sup>for Mary stiffened her expression as soon as she told her that Alonde was coming, and she was disappointed to leave her seat.</sup></p>
<p id="L5">Incidentally, the construction has recently gotten back on track, and we are almost comfortable leaving it to the craftsmen.<br><sup>ちなみに、最近では工事は軌道に乗り、ほぼ職人任せでも平気な状態になっている。</sup><br><sup>By the way, the construction work has recently been on track, and it has become almost all right to leave it to the staff to themselves.</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">"What, you've restored the price and reduced the trading volume by 50%?　Isn't that some kind of mistake?"<br><sup>「えっ、値段を元に戻したうえに取引量が５割減ですか？　何かの間違いではありませんか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, is there a 50% reduction in transaction volume besides restoring the price?"Isn't it something wrong?"</sup></p>
<p id="L8"><br></p>
<p id="L9">When Kazuyoshi told him about the exchange with Nibel that Liese had told her about the other day, Arondo raised an eyebrow as if he didn't understand.<br><sup>先日リーゼから聞いたニーベルとのやり取りを一良が伝えると、アロンドは合点がいかないといったように眉をひそめた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira told her about the conversation with Nibel that Liese had heard the other day, Alond frowned as if he didn't understand.</sup></p>
<p id="L10"><br></p>
<p id="L11">"No, that's what Lise told me. I heard that's what Nibel told her during the interview. I don't think she's been officially notified yet, though.<br><sup>「いや、リーゼがそう言ってたんですよ。面会の時にニーベルさんからそう伝えられたらしいんです。正式な通達はまだみたいですけど」</sup><br><sup>"No, that's what Liese said.It seems that Mr. Nibel told me so at the meeting.I don't think I've received a formal notice yet."</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">"I see, ......, but how much can a 50 percent reduction be ......?"<br><sup>「そうなのですか……しかし、５割減はいくらなんでも……」</sup><br><sup>"Is that so... but any 50% reduction..."</sup></p>
<p id="L14"><br></p>
<p id="L15">Arondo had been investigating the unseasonable weather in Gregorn territory since Ichiran had asked him to do so.<br><sup>アロンドは一良に依頼されてから、グレゴルン領の天候不順について調べていた。</sup><br><sup>Alondo had been investigating the inclement weather in Gregorne since he was commissioned by Ichira.</sup></p>
<p id="L16">There was indeed information about the weather irregularities that were occurring, and I was able to hear from my father, Noor.<br><sup>確かに天候不順が起こっているという情報はあり、父のノールからも話を聞くことができた。</sup><br><sup>There was certainly information that the weather was bad, and I could hear from my father, Noor.</sup></p>
<p id="L17">However, we have not heard that the weather has worsened to the extent that we need to cut our trading volume in half.<br><sup>だが、取引量を半分にしなければならないというほどにまで、天候が悪化しているといった話は聞いていない。</sup><br><sup>But I haven't heard that the weather is getting worse enough to halve the volume of transactions.</sup></p>
<p id="L18"><br></p>
<p id="L19">"Have you heard anything about anything happening in Gregorian territory?　Problems with the saltworks?"<br><sup>「グレゴルン領で何かあったといった話は聞きませんか？　製塩作業に問題が生じたとか」</sup><br><sup>"Have you heard of anything going on in Gregorne's territory?"There's been a problem with salt production."</sup></p>
<p id="L20"><br></p>
<p id="L21">"I've heard that there's been some unsettled weather, but other than that, I haven't heard anything.<br><sup>「若干の天候不順が続いているという話は聞きましたが、それ以外は何も聞いておりません」</sup><br><sup>"I've heard that the weather continues to be a little bad, but I haven't heard anything else."</sup></p>
<p id="L22"><br></p>
<p id="L23">"Hmmm, ......, that's something I don't understand."<br><sup>「ふむ……なんだか分からない話ですね」</sup><br><sup>"Well... I don't know what it is."</sup></p>
<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25">Arondo was pondering with a mysterious look on his face, but eventually he looked up and opened his mouth.<br><sup>アロンドは神妙な面持ちで考え込んでいたが、やがて顔を上げると口を開いた。</sup><br><sup>Alond was thinking with a mysterious look on his face, but soon he looked up and spoke.</sup></p>
<p id="L26"><br></p>
<p id="L27">"Lady Kazura, have you noticed anything unusual about Miss Lise's condition?"<br><sup>「カズラ様、リーゼ様のご様子に何か変わったところはありませんでしたか？」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Kazura, was there anything unusual about Mr. Liese?"</sup></p>
<p id="L28"><br></p>
<p id="L29">"Do I look different?"<br><sup>「変わった様子、ですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Is it unusual?"</sup></p>
<p id="L30"><br></p>
<p id="L31">"Yes. I have heard rumors that Nibel-dono has been obsessed with Liese-sama for some time now. In light of the fact that salt has been sold at a discount to the Istair family for the past four years since we started meeting, it is possible that he used the deal as a shield to force her to marry or go out with him. Perhaps, though, Liese-sama may have brushed it off."<br><sup>「はい。以前より、ニーベル殿はリーゼ様に執心しているという噂を聞いております。面会を始めた４年前から塩が２割引でイステール家に販売されているということと照らし合わせて考えると、取引を盾にして結婚や付き合いを強要したといったこともありえるかと。おそらくですが、リーゼ様はそれを突っぱねたのではないでしょうか」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I've heard for a long time that Mr. Nibel is committed to Mr. Liese.Considering that salt has been sold to the Istair family at a 20% discount since four years ago, I think it's possible that they forced them to marry or go out with each other under the pretext of a deal.Perhaps Mr. Liese rejected it."</sup></p>
<p id="L32"><br></p>
<p id="L33">"Does that mean you've been preparing for four years to make this threat?<br><sup>「え、それって、今回脅しをかけるために４年前から準備してたってことですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that means you've been preparing for four years to make a threat this time?"</sup></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35">"Maybe. I can't say for sure."<br><sup>「かもしれません。断言はできませんが」</sup><br><sup>"Perhaps.I can't say for sure."</sup></p>
<p id="L36"><br></p>
<p id="L37">Liese has not told anyone, including Kazura, that she was threatened or almost attacked by Nibel.<br><sup>リーゼはニーベルに脅されたり襲われかけたということを、一良を含めた誰にも言っていない。</sup><br><sup>Liese didn't tell anyone, including Ichira, that she was threatened or almost attacked by Nibel.</sup></p>
<p id="L38">Because there was no one else who could testify to what had happened, and I didn't want people to think that I had done something to them.<br><sup>その時の状況を証言できる者が他にいないため、何かされてしまったのではと思われることが嫌だったからだ。</sup><br><sup>for he did not like to think that something had been done because no one else could testify to the situation at that time.</sup></p>
<p id="L39">All Liese told Kazuyoshi was that the amount of salt traded would be cut in half and that the price would return to the normal level.<br><sup>リーゼが一良に伝えたことは、塩の取引量が半分になるということと、値段が通常と同じ水準に戻るということだけである。</sup><br><sup>All Liese told Ichira was that the salt trade would be halved and that the price would return to normal levels.</sup></p>
<p id="L40"><br></p>
<p id="L41">"But he said the other day that he would always have an escort with him when he visits, so I don't think he was threatened. ......<br><sup>「でも、面会をする時は必ず護衛を付けるようにするってこの間言ってたんで、脅されたってことはないかと思うんですけど……」</sup><br><sup>"But the other day you said you would always have a bodyguard when you met him, so I don't think you've ever been threatened..."</sup></p>
<p id="L42"><br></p>
<p id="L43">"Were you sure you had an escort for that meeting?"<br><sup>「その時の面会でも、確実に護衛は付いていたのですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Was there certainly a bodyguard at the meeting?"</sup></p>
<p id="L44"><br></p>
<p id="L45">"That's ...... hard to tell."<br><sup>「それは……分かりませんね」</sup><br><sup>"That's... I don't know,"</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">When Kazuyoshi answered, Arondo nodded with a serious expression.<br><sup>一良が答えると、アロンドは真剣な表情で頷いた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira answered, Alondo nodded with a serious expression.</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">"If the meeting was held under the circumstances I mentioned earlier, Liese would not want to tell anyone about the threat. It would be very disgraceful for Liese-sama, the daughter of a great nobleman, to be threatened by a commoner merchant, even if he is a major figure in another territory. It makes sense that you have not told Kazura-sama anything."<br><sup>「もし先ほど申し上げたような状況で面会がされたならば、脅されたことをリーゼ様は他人に話すことは避けたいはずです。他領の重鎮とはいえ、平民である一商人に大貴族の娘であるリーゼ様が脅されるということ自体が、大変不名誉なことですから。カズラ様に何もお話していないことにも納得がいきます」</sup><br><sup>"If you were to see me in the situation I mentioned earlier, Mr. Liese would like to avoid telling others what he has been threatened.Even though she is an important figure in other territories, it is very disgraceful that a merchant, who is a commoner, threatens Liese, the daughter of a great aristocrat.I understand that I have not told Kazura anything."</sup></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51">"I see. If it's ......, then I can't let him get away with it.<br><sup>「なるほど……だとしたら、彼のことは許せませんね」</sup><br><sup>"Well... then I can't forgive him."</sup></p>
<p id="L52"><br></p>
<p id="L53">"Yes. I will make inquiries about Nibel-dono. In some cases, it may develop into a situation where we have to make the first move, but I hope you will leave it to me to deal with.<br><sup>「はい。ニーベル殿に対しては私が探りを入れておきます。場合によっては先手を打たねばならない事態に発展する可能性がありますが、対処は私にお任せいただければと」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I will inquire into Mr. Nibel.Depending on the situation, it may develop into a situation where we have to take the initiative, but I would appreciate it if you could leave the matter to me."</sup></p>
<p id="L54"><br></p>
<p id="L55">"I understand. But I can help you with something, too. Is there anything I can do?"<br><sup>「分かりました。でも、私も何か手伝いますよ。できることはありませんか？」</sup><br><sup>"All right.But I'll help you, too. Is there anything I can do?"</sup></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">"Thank you very much. Then, if I need help, I will not hesitate to ask for it."<br><sup>「ありがとうございます。では、力をお借りしたい時は遠慮なく頼らせていただきます」</sup><br><sup>"Thank you very much.Well, if you want to help me, I'll feel free to rely on you."</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">Arondo replied to Kazuyoshi's offer with a soft smile.<br><sup>一良の申し出に、アロンドは柔らかく微笑んで答える。</sup><br><sup>Alondo responds with a soft smile to Ichira's offer.</sup></p>
<p id="L60">It's a really nice smile that makes people feel at ease.<br><sup>人を安心させるような、実に見事な微笑みだ。</sup><br><sup>It's such a beautiful smile that makes people feel at ease.</sup></p>
<p id="L61"><br></p>
<p id="L62">"I think you should talk to Mr. Narson and Mr. Zirconia about this. I'll talk to them later. ......"<br><sup>「ナルソンさんとジルコニアさんにも相談をしたほうがいいですね。後で私から話を……」</sup><br><sup>"You should consult with Mr. Narson and Mr. Zirconia, too.I'll talk to you later..."</sup></p>
<p id="L63"><br></p>
<p id="L64">"No, I think it would be best if we handle this matter on our own. Mr. Narson is a very busy man, and we should avoid causing him any distress. Besides, if word gets out to Zirconia-sama, there is a possibility that she may resort to direct action. It could result in a rift between the two territories."<br><sup>「いえ、この件は我々だけで対処するのがよいかと。ナルソン様は大変多忙なご様子ですので、心労をかけさせるようなことは避けるべきです。それに、ジルコニア様に話が伝わると、場合によっては直接的な手段に訴える可能性があります。二ヶ領が険悪になる結果を招きかねません」</sup><br><sup>"No, I think it's better for us to deal with this matter alone.Mr. Naruson seems very busy, so you should avoid causing trouble.In addition, if the story is conveyed to Zirconia, it may resort to direct means in some cases.The two territories may become dangerous."</sup></p>
<p id="L65"><br></p>
<p id="L66">When Arondo denies the suggestion, Kazura tilts his head.<br><sup>提案を否定するアロンドに、一良が首を傾げる。</sup><br><sup>Ichira tilts his head at Alondo, who denies the proposal.</sup></p>
<p id="L67"><br></p>
<p id="L68">What do you mean by "direct means"?<br><sup>「直接的な手段というと？」</sup><br><sup>"What do you mean by direct means?"</sup></p>
<p id="L69"><br></p>
<p id="L70">"Zirconia-sama is a merciless person, and if the threats are found to be true, she will retaliate thoroughly, even at the risk of exposing the information. That's the kind of person she is."<br><sup>「ジルコニア様は容赦がないお方なので、もし脅されたことが事実だと判明した場合、それらの情報が露見する危険を冒してでも徹底的な報復をするでしょう。あの方はそういうお方です」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Zirconia is a relentless person, so if it turns out to be true that he has been threatened, he will retaliate thoroughly even at the risk of exposing such information.That's the way he is."</sup></p>
<p id="L71"><br></p>
<p id="L72">When he was told that, Kazuyoshi recalled Zirconia's warm expression that he had seen often lately.<br><sup>そう言われ、一良は最近よく見るようになったジルコニアのほんわかとした表情を思い起こした。</sup><br><sup>This reminded him of the soft expression of zirconia, which he had recently become familiar with.</sup></p>
<p id="L73">It's true that there have been cases before where captured thieves were executed after interrogation (Kazura doesn't know that Zirconia even went so far as to torture her herself) and exposed to the elements, but it's hard to say whether they would go through with something like what Arondo is talking about.<br><sup>確かに、捕らえた野盗を尋問後に処刑（ジルコニアが自ら拷問まで行ったことを一良は知らない）して晒し首にしたといったことは以前あったが、アロンドの言うような手段に出るかと言われるといまいちピンとこない。</sup><br><sup>It is true that he executed the captured thief after interrogation (Ichira didn't know Zirconia had tortured him himself) and exposed his neck, but it doesn't make sense to me to ask him if he would resort to the means Alondo says.</sup></p>
<p id="L74">Besides, it seemed like a bad idea to proceed in secret from the girls.<br><sup>それに、彼女たちに秘密でことを進めるというのは、悪手に思えて仕方がない。</sup><br><sup>Besides, I can't help but think it's a bad move to keep things secret from them.</sup></p>
<p id="L75">Even if Zirconia tried to take direct action, Kazuyoshi thought that he and Narson would be able to remonstrate with her.<br><sup>たとえジルコニアが直接的な手段に出ようとしても、自分やナルソンが諌めれば大丈夫だろうと一良は考えた。</sup><br><sup>Even if zirconia tried to take direct measures, Ichira thought it would be all right if he or Narson advised him.</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">"'No, I think I'll talk to Mr. Narson and the others here. I'll take care of Miss Zirconia for you."<br><sup>「いや、ここはナルソンさんたちにも話をしておこうと思います。ジルコニアさんのことは私が見ておきますから」</sup><br><sup>"No, I'm going to talk to the Narusons here, too.I'll take care of Mr. Zirconia."</sup></p>
<p id="L78"><br></p>
<p id="L79">"Well, ......, that's fine. If you need anything else, just let us know and we'll do whatever we can to help."<br><sup>「そうですか……かしこまりました。何かあれば申しつけていただければ何でもいたしますので、お声掛けください」</sup><br><sup>"Well... certainly.If you need anything, I'll do anything for you, so please let me know."</sup></p>
<p id="L80"><br></p>
<p id="L81">"I understand, and I look forward to working with you when the time comes.<br><sup>「分かりました、その時はよろしくお願いします」</sup><br><sup>"All right, I'll take good care of you then."</sup></p>
<p id="L82"><br></p>
<p id="L83">Kazuyoshi nodded and decided to discuss the possibility that had been bothering him for some time.<br><sup>一良は頷くと、以前から気になっていた可能性についても相談してみることにした。</sup><br><sup>Ichira nodded and decided to discuss the possibility that he had been curious about for a long time.</sup></p>
<p id="L84"><br></p>
<p id="L85">"By the way, Mr. Arondo, have you ever heard of a 'salt lake'?"<br><sup>「ところでアロンドさん、“塩湖”って聞いたことありますか？」</sup><br><sup>"By the way, Mr. Alondo, have you ever heard of Salt Lake?"</sup></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">"Is it Enko?　No, I've never heard of it. Can you please explain it to me at ......?"<br><sup>「“えんこ”ですか？　いえ、聞いたことがありませんが……ご説明いただいてもよろしいでしょうか？」</sup><br><sup>"Is it "enko"?No, I've never heard of it, but could you explain it to me?"</sup></p>
<p id="L88"><br></p>
<p id="L89">A "salt lake" is a lake that contains a large amount of salt. Sometimes salt crystals can be collected directly from the bottom of the lake or from the surrounding area. If there are salt lakes in Gregorian territory, it would explain the production and quality of salt. It's very rare, but there are such places inland."<br><sup>「塩湖とは、塩分を大量に含んだ湖のことです。湖の底や周辺からは塩の結晶が直接採取できることもあります。もしグレゴルン領に塩湖があれば、塩の生産量や品質についても説明がつくと思いまして。ごく稀にですが、内陸にそういった場所が存在するんです」</sup><br><sup>"A salt lake is a lake that contains a lot of salt.Sometimes salt crystals can be collected directly from the bottom and periphery of the lake.If there was a salt lake in Gregorne, I would be able to explain the production and quality of salt.Very rarely, but there are places like that inland."</sup></p>
<p id="L90"><br></p>
<p id="L91">I had heard from Lise once that there was considerably more wildlife in Gregorian territory than in other territories.<br><sup>以前、リーゼからグレゴルン領には野生動物が他領よりもかなり多いと聞いたことがあった。</sup><br><sup>I have heard from Liese that there are many wild animals in Gregorne's territory.</sup></p>
<p id="L92">This made him think 'maybe' in comparison to the quality and production of salt.<br><sup>そのことから、塩の品質や生産量と照らし合わせて、『もしかしたら』と考えていたのだ。</sup><br><sup>Therefore, I thought 'maybe' in comparison with the quality and production of salt.</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94">In areas where there is access to salt, the survival rate of wild herbivores is considerably higher.<br><sup>塩を摂取できる場所がある地域では、野生の草食動物の生存率がかなり高くなる。</sup><br><sup>In areas where salt is available, wild herbivores have a significant survival rate.</sup></p>
<p id="L95">This is because salt helps with digestion and absorption, and the nutritional status of the animal will be much better in an environment where salt can be supplied frequently.<br><sup>塩には消化吸収を助ける役割があるので、頻繁に塩を補給できる環境では動物の栄養状態がぐっと良くなるからだ。</sup><br><sup>This is because salt helps digestion and absorption, so if salt is replenished frequently, the nutritional status of animals will be much better.</sup></p>
<p id="L96">In winter, when food is scarce, this tendency is even more pronounced.<br><sup>食料の乏しい冬は、その傾向がより顕著である。</sup><br><sup>This tendency is more pronounced in winter when food is scarce.</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">"...... No, I've never heard of such a thing being in Gregorian territory. Besides, if there were such a thing, it would have been rumored."<br><sup>「……いえ、そういったものがグレゴルン領にあるとは聞いたことがありません。それに、もしそのようなものがあれば噂になっているはずです」</sup><br><sup>"...no, I've never heard of such things in Gregorian territory.Besides, if there was such a thing, it would have been rumored."</sup></p>
<p id="L99"><br></p>
<p id="L100">"I'll look into it, but I was wondering if you could help me. I'll look into it myself, but I'd appreciate it if you could look into it as well, Alondo-san.<br><sup>「確かにそうなんですが、もしやと思いまして。私のほうでも調べますが、アロンドさんも探りを入れていただけると助かります」</sup><br><sup>"It is true, but I thought it might be.I'll look into it myself, but I'd appreciate it if Mr. Alonde could make some inquiries."</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">"Very well, sir. If the salt lake exists, you mean to use it as a bargaining chip in some cases?"<br><sup>「かしこまりました。もし塩湖が存在したら、場合によっては交渉の材料に使うということですね？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, sir.If there is a salt lake, it will be used as a bargaining chip, right?"</sup></p>
<p id="L103"><br></p>
<p id="L104">"Yes. If he has the power to decide how much salt to trade on his own, he may be holding the salt lake but hiding its existence from his lord. If that's the case, something bad would happen to him if it were made public."<br><sup>「ええ。彼が自分だけの判断で塩の取引量を決定できるほどの権限をもっているとすれば、塩湖を保有しながらも領主には存在を隠している可能性があります。もしそうなら、それが公表されると彼にとって都合が悪いことが起こるはずです」</sup><br><sup>"Yes. If he has the authority to decide the amount of salt to trade at his own discretion, he may have a salt lake, but not a lord.If that's the case, something bad should happen to him when it's made public."</sup></p>
<p id="L105"><br></p>
<p id="L106">"Yes, if you conceal such a thing, you may face confiscation of property. I'll look into it as soon as possible."<br><sup>「そうですね、そのようなことを隠していれば財産没収の憂き目にあってもおかしくありません。そちらについても、早急に調査してみます」</sup><br><sup>"Well, if you hide such a thing, you could be in danger of confiscating your property.I will also look into that matter as soon as possible."</sup></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">After finishing his meal, Arondo left his seat and bowed to Ichiran.<br><sup>アロンドは食事を済ませると席を立ち、一良に一礼した。</sup><br><sup>When Alondo had finished his meal, he left his seat and bowed to Ichira.</sup></p>
<p id="L109"><br></p>
<p id="L110">"I'll leave you to it then. I will contact you as soon as I have more information."<br><sup>「それでは、私はこれにて失礼いたします。情報が入り次第すぐにご連絡いたしますので」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I must excuse myself.I'll get back to you as soon as I get the information."</sup></p>
<p id="L111"><br></p>
<p id="L112">"Yes, thank you. ...... Um, Mr. Alondo?"<br><sup>「はい、よろしくお願いします。……あの、アロンドさん？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, thank you very much....you know, Mr. Alonde?"</sup></p>
<p id="L113"><br></p>
<p id="L114">"What is it?<br><sup>「何か？」</sup><br><sup>"What is it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L115"><br></p>
<p id="L116">As Arondo turned away to leave, Kazura called out to him.<br><sup>立ち去ろうと背を向けたアロンドに、一良は声をかけた。</sup><br><sup>Ichira called out to Alondo, who turned his back to leave.</sup></p>
<p id="L117">Arondo quickly turned around and gave his usual calm expression to Kazuyoshi.<br><sup>アロンドはすぐに振り返り、いつもどおりの穏やかな表情を一良に向ける。</sup><br><sup>Arond immediately looks back and turns his usual calm expression on Ichira.</sup></p>
<p id="L118"><br></p>
<p id="L119">"...... No, it's nothing. I look forward to working with you."<br><sup>「……いえ、何でもありません。よろしくお願いしますね」</sup><br><sup>"...no, it's nothing.I look forward to your kind cooperation."</sup></p>
<p id="L120"><br></p>
<p id="L121">"Yes, I'll take care of it. Excuse me."<br><sup>「はい、お任せください。失礼いたします」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, leave it to me.Excuse me."</sup></p>
<p id="L122"><br></p>

<p id="L127">When he explained about the salt lake, it seemed to Kazuyoshi that for just a moment there was a hint of anger in Arondo's eyes.<br><sup>塩湖の説明をした際、ほんの一瞬だけアロンドの瞳に怒りの色が浮かんだように一良には見えた。</sup><br><sup>When he explained Salt Lake, Alond's eyes seemed angry for only a moment.</sup></p>

<p id="L129">Tipping his head back, Kazuyoshi resumed eating and ruminating on the conversation he had just had.<br><sup>一良は首を傾げながら食事を再開し、先ほどの会話を反芻するのだった。</sup><br><sup>Ichira resumed his meal with his head tilted and ruminated on the conversation.</sup></p>

<p id="L136">After calling Narson and Zirconia to his room, Kazura immediately regretted ignoring Arondo's advice.<br><sup>自室にナルソンとジルコニアを呼び出した一良は、アロンドの忠告を無視したことをさっそく後悔していた。</sup><br><sup>Ichira, who called Narson and Zirconia into his room, immediately regretted ignoring Alond's advice.</sup></p>

<p id="L146"><br></p>
<p id="L147">"No, basically because the messenger has quite a few guards with him ......, or even a small number, it's unlikely that a bandit would attack a group with guards. It is obviously too unnatural. Rather, why do we suddenly jump to assassination?"<br><sup>「いや、基本的に使者はかなりの数の護衛を連れているから……というか、たとえ少数でも護衛が付いている集団を野盗が襲うことなんてまずないだろう。明らかに不自然すぎる。むしろ、どうしていきなり暗殺にまで話が飛ぶんだ」</sup><br><sup>"Basically, messengers have quite a few guards with them... or even a few, it is unlikely that a burglar will attack a group with guards.Obviously, it's too unnatural.Rather, why is it that the story of assassination suddenly spread?"</sup></p>

<p id="L222">"Why don't we just stop all the exploratory drilling in the city and use the well drillers in other places?　If we dig 150 wells and only get water in five of them, that's not very efficient.<br><sup>「いっそのこと街なかの試掘は全部取りやめて、別の場所で井戸掘り機を使ったらどうかな？　１５０ヵ所掘って５箇所しか水が出ないんじゃ、効率が悪すぎるよ」</sup><br><sup>"Why don't you stop all the trial drilling in the city and use a well digger somewhere else?

<p id="L227">If I had to pick one thing, it would be that Liese has started to follow Kazuyoshi around more than before.<br><sup>しいて挙げるとすれば、リーゼは前よりも一良の後を付いて回るようになってきたということだろうか。</sup><br><sup>To force you to say, is Liese starting to follow Ichira more than before?</sup></p>

<p id="L266">Behind them as they talked amicably, Isaac sneaked a look at Havel.<br><sup>和気あいあいと話す２人の後ろで、アイザックはこっそりとハベルに顔を寄せた。</sup><br><sup>Behind the friendly conversation, Isaac secretly turned to Hubbell.</sup></p>

<p id="L271"><br></p>
<p id="L272">"Oh, yeah. ......<br><sup>「そ、そうか……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I see..."</sup></p>
<p id="L273"><br></p>
<p id="L274">"...... Master Isaac, what have you done?"<br><sup>「……アイザック様、何かやらかしたんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"... Mr. Isaac, have you done anything?"</sup></p>
<p id="L275"><br></p>
<p id="L276">Havel asks Isaac, who is looking a little pale.<br><sup>若干顔色を悪くしているアイザックに、ハベルが問いかける。</sup><br><sup>Hubbard asks Isaac, who looks a little pale.</sup></p>
<p id="L277"><br></p>

<p id="L279"><br></p>
<p id="L280">In the meantime, the six of us arrived at the square.<br><sup>そうこうしているうちに、６人は広場に到着した。</sup><br><sup>In the meantime, the six arrived at the square.</sup></p>
<p id="L281">At the same time, a carriage came into the square, accompanied by cavalry.<br><sup>それと同時に、１台の馬車が騎兵に連れられて広場に入ってきた。</sup><br><sup>At the same time, a carriage was led into the square by cavalry.</sup></p>
<p id="L282"><br></p>
<p id="L283">"Oh, that carriage. Now let's see what he looks like."<br><sup>「お、あの馬車か。さて、どんな人かな」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that carriage.Well, what kind of person is he?"</sup></p>
<p id="L284"><br></p>
<p id="L285">The carriage approached slowly, the sound of hoofbeats echoing in the distance.<br><sup>ぱからぱからと蹄の音を響かせて、馬車はゆっくりと近寄ってくる。</sup><br><sup>With a rustling sound of his hoofs, the carriage slowly approached him.</sup></p>
<p id="L286">It was an opulent carriage of the private room type like the one Kazuyoshi had ridden in before, with the family crest of the Suran family painted on the upper section.<br><sup>以前一良が乗ったような個室タイプの豪勢な馬車で、上段にはスラン家の家紋が描かれていた。</sup><br><sup>It was a luxurious carriage with a private compartment like Ichira used to ride, and the family crest of the Suran family was painted on the top.</sup></p>
<p id="L287"><br></p>
<p id="L288">"...... Hmm?"<br><sup>「……ん？」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L289"><br></p>
<p id="L290">The moment Kazuyoshi's eyes met the blue eyes peeking out of the window of the carriage parked in front of him, he let out a cry.<br><sup>目の前に横付けされた馬車の窓からのぞく青い瞳と目が合い、一良が声を漏らした瞬間。</sup><br><sup>The moment Ichira spoke out of his blue eyes peeping through the window of the carriage next to him.</sup></p>
<p id="L291">The door of the carriage opened with a bang.<br><sup>馬車の扉が、ばんと開いた。</sup><br><sup>The carriage door banged open.</sup></p>
<p id="L292"><br></p>
<p id="L293">"Mr. Kazura!<br><sup>「カズラさんっ！！」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Kazura!"</sup></p>
<p id="L294"><br></p>
<p id="L295">"Geez!"<br><sup>「げふっ！？」</sup><br><sup>"Huh!"</sup></p>
<p id="L296"><br></p>
<p id="L297">Baretta, dressed in a beautiful outfit and with a big smile on her face, jumped into Kazuyoshi's chest as if she was going to hit him.<br><sup>小奇麗な衣装に身を包み、満面の笑みを湛えたバレッタが、体当たりするかのような勢いで一良の胸に飛び込んだ。</sup><br><sup>Valletta, dressed in neat clothes and full of smiles, jumped into Ichira's chest as if she were hitting her body.</sup></p>
<p id="L298">Havel, who was behind her, hurriedly supported her body, which was almost blown away by the impact.<br><sup>その衝撃で危うく吹っ飛びそうになったその身体を、背後にいたハベルが慌てて支える。</sup><br><sup>The Hubbell behind him hurriedly supports his body, which was about to fly away due to the impact.</sup></p>
<p id="L299"><br></p>
<p id="L300">"Ba, Ms. Valletta!　Why ......?"<br><sup>「バ、バレッタさん！？　どうして……」</sup><br><sup>"Ba, Mr. Valletta!?Why..."</sup></p>
<p id="L301"><br></p>
<p id="L302">"I can do so many things now!"<br><sup>「私、色んなことができるようになりました！」</sup><br><sup>"I've learned a lot of things!"</sup></p>
<p id="L303"><br></p>
<p id="L304">As if to cover the words of Kazuyoshi, who was peeling his eyes in surprise, Baretta looked at Kazuyoshi and spoke at once.<br><sup>驚いて目を剥いている一良の言葉に被せるように、バレッタは一良を見つめて一気にまくし立てる。</sup><br><sup>Valletta looks at Ichira and starts talking all at once, as if she were covering her eyes with surprise.</sup></p>

<p id="L306">"Mechanical design, building construction, martial arts, medicine, and pharmaceutical refining!　I won't let you slow me down anymore!　I'll be useful!　So go to ......."<br><sup>「機械設計も建物の建築も、武術も医学も薬品の精製も！　もう、絶対に足手まといにはなりません！　きっと役に立ってみせます！！　だから……」</sup><br><sup>"Mechanical design, building construction, martial arts, medicine, and drug refining!"I'm sure I'll be of help to you!!So..."</sup></p>
<p id="L307"><br></p>
<p id="L308">He then grabbed Kazuyoshi's clothes, holding them even tighter.<br><sup>そしていっそう強く、掴んでいる一良の服を握った。</sup><br><sup>Then he grabbed Ichira's clothes harder.</sup></p>
<p id="L309">There were some tears in the corners of her eyes, and she looked up at Kazuyoshi as if clinging to him.<br><sup>目尻には若干涙が浮かび、縋るように一良を見上げている。</sup><br><sup>There were some tears at the corners of his eyes, and he looked up at Ichira clingingly.</sup></p>
<p id="L310"><br></p>
<p id="L311">"So please let me stay by your side, Kazura-san."<br><sup>「だから、カズラさんの傍にいさせてください」</sup><br><sup>"So let me stay with Mr. Kazura said.</sup></p>
<p id="L312"><br></p>
<p id="L313">"Oh, yes. Please."<br><sup>「あ、はい。お願いします」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, yes, please."</sup></p>
<p id="L314"><br></p>
<p id="L315">Kazuyoshi couldn't help but reply in a distracted manner to Baretta's devil-may-care tone.<br><sup>鬼気迫る様子で言うバレッタに、思わず一良は気の抜けるような返事を返してしまう。</sup><br><sup>Ichira unconsciously replies to Valletta, who says it in a demonic manner.</sup></p>
<p id="L316"><br></p>
<p id="L317">"Hey, are you sure it's ......?"<br><sup>「ほ、本当……ですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, really...?"</sup></p>
<p id="L318"><br></p>
<p id="L319">"Of course. That's exactly what I want to ask you to do. I mean, what kind of craftsman is Baretta-san, ......?<br><sup>「もちろんです。それこそこっちからお願いしたいくらいで。ていうか、職人ってバレッタさんのこと……ってちょっと！？」</sup><br><sup>"Of course.That's exactly what I want you to do.I mean, craftsmen mean Valletta... a little!?</sup></p>
<p id="L320"><br></p>
<p id="L321">"Wheeeeee!"<br><sup>「ふえええん」</sup><br><sup>"Well,"</sup></p>
<p id="L322"><br></p>
<p id="L323">Kazuyoshi hurriedly soothed Baretta, who burst into tears, spilling large tears.<br><sup>ぼろぼろと大粒の涙をこぼして泣き出したバレッタを、一良は慌ててなだめる。</sup><br><sup>Kazura soothes Valletta in a hurry when she starts crying with tears in large drops.</sup></p>
<p id="L324">While everyone was looking on dumbfounded, Isaac was the only one with his head in his hands.<br><sup>皆が唖然とその様子を見守るなか、アイザック１人だけが頭を抱えていた。</sup><br><sup>As everyone watched him dumbfounded, Isaac was the only one holding his head.</sup></p>
