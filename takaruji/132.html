<p id="L1">At the same time, on the outskirts of the village of Grisea, Barletta and the artisans were taking a break in front of the brick kiln.<br><sup>その頃、グリセア村のはずれでは、バレッタと職人たちがレンガ窯の前で一息ついていた。</sup><br><sup>At that time, on the outskirts of the village of Glyceria, Valletta and the craftsmen were taking a breather in front of the brick kiln.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">The kiln is filled with raw firebricks, which are now being slowly heated to nearly 200 degrees for drying.<br><sup>窯の中には生の耐火レンガが入れられており、今は乾燥のために２００度近くまでゆっくり暖めているところだ。</sup><br><sup>Raw refractory bricks are placed in the kiln and are now slowly warming to nearly 200 degrees Celsius for drying.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">It takes half a day to dry, and from there it must be slowly heated for another half day to a temperature of nearly 1000 degrees Celsius.<br><sup>乾燥には半日かかり、そこから更に半日かけて１０００度近い高温にまでゆっくりと熱しなければならない。</sup><br><sup>It takes half a day to dry, and then it takes another half a day to slowly heat to a high temperature of nearly 1,000 degrees Celsius.</sup></p>
<p id="L4"><br></p>
<p id="L5">"Will the drying be finished by midnight?<br><sup>「乾燥が終わるのは夜中かい？」</sup><br><sup>"Is it late at night when the dryness is over?"</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">"Yes. Then we'll increase the heat for another half day to stabilize the temperature.<br><sup>「はい。そしたらまた半日かけて火力を上げて、温度を安定させます」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, then it will take half a day to raise the firepower and stabilize the temperature."</sup></p>
<p id="L8"><br></p>
<p id="L9">"So it's just like a regular brick in that area."<br><sup>「その辺は普通のレンガと一緒なんだな」</sup><br><sup>"It's the same as ordinary bricks,"</sup></p>
<p id="L10"><br></p>
<p id="L11">"The only difference is the ingredients. The only other difference is the temperature control.<br><sup>「材料が違うだけですからね。他に違うのは温度管理くらいです」</sup><br><sup>"The ingredients are just different.The only other difference is temperature control."</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">Since we have brought a large amount of raw bricks, we will be manufacturing fire bricks in Grisea Village for a while.<br><sup>生レンガは大量に持ってきてあるため、しばらくの間はグリセア村で耐火レンガを製造することになる。</sup><br><sup>Due to the large amount of raw bricks brought in, refractory bricks will be made in Glyceria Village for a while.</sup></p>
<p id="L14">There is a stockpile of fire bricks that were originally made by Baretta and her team, but there are far too few of them to build a brick furnace in Isteria.<br><sup>元々バレッタたちが作った耐火レンガの備蓄もあるにはあるが、イステリアでレンガ炉を造るには数が圧倒的に足りないからだ。</sup><br><sup>Although there is a stockpile of firebricks originally made by Valletta, the number of brick furnaces is overwhelmingly insufficient.</sup></p>
<p id="L15">Some of the craftsmen would need to stay in Grisea Village and work with the villagers to get used to the production process.<br><sup>職人の何人かにはグリセア村に残ってもらい、村人たちと一緒に作業をしながら製作に慣れてもらう必要があるだろう。</sup><br><sup>Some of the craftsmen will need to stay in the village of Glycer, work with the villagers, and get used to the production.</sup></p>
<p id="L16">Near Baretta and her friends, under the roof of a hut where firewood was stacked, Lise and Zirconia were crouched on the ground, kneading a dark dumpling-like substance with their children.<br><sup>そんなバレッタたちのすぐ近く、薪が積まれている小屋の屋根の下では、リーゼとジルコニアが地面にしゃがみ込んで子供たちと一緒に真っ黒な団子状のものをこねていた。</sup><br><sup>Close to these valetas, under the roof of the wooded hut, Liese and Zirconia crouched down on the ground and kneaded with the children a black dumpling.</sup></p>
<p id="L17"><br></p>
<p id="L18">"Ugh, my hands are cold. I'm surprised you're all okay."<br><sup>「うう、手が冷たい。皆よく平気だね」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, my hands are cold.They're all fine, aren'</sup></p>
<p id="L19"><br></p>
<p id="L20">"Really, it's so cold it's starting to hurt."<br><sup>「本当、冷たすぎて痛くなってきちゃったわ」</sup><br><sup>"It's so cold that it's starting to hurt."</sup></p>
<p id="L21"><br></p>
<p id="L22">Everyone's hands were black, and Lise and Zirconia were kneading the dumplings, occasionally exhaling into their hands to warm them up.<br><sup>皆の手は真っ黒で、リーゼとジルコニアは時折手に息を吐きかけて暖めながら団子をこねていた。</sup><br><sup>Everyone's hands were black, and Liese and Zirconia were kneading dumplings with occasional breaths on their hands.</sup></p>
<p id="L23">As it was the end of November, the wind blew very cold at times.<br><sup>11月末ということもあって、時折吹く風はとても冷たい。</sup><br><sup>Since it's the end of November, the occasional wind is very cold.</sup></p>
<p id="L24">As I kneaded the damp dumplings in the midst of all this, my hands couldn't help but get numb.<br><sup>そんななかで湿った団子をこねているので、手がかじかんで仕方がなかった。</sup><br><sup>My hands were so cold that I couldn't help but kneading wet dumplings.</sup></p>
<p id="L25"><br></p>
<p id="L26">"I'm not fine!　But it's fun!"<br><sup>「平気じゃないよ！　でも楽しいよ！」</sup><br><sup>"I don't mind! But it's fun!"</sup></p>
<p id="L27"><br></p>
<p id="L28">"When I make a lot, my mother praises me. It's a good substitute for charcoal."<br><sup>「たくさん作ると、お母さんが褒めてくれるの。これ、炭の代わりになるんだよ」</sup><br><sup>"If you make a lot, your mother compliments you.This will replace charcoal."</sup></p>
<p id="L29"><br></p>
<p id="L30">The dumplings we make are made with tadon, a fuel made from charcoal powder rolled up with water and a binder.<br><sup>作っている団子は<ruby><rb>炭団</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>たどん</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>という、木炭の粉を水とつなぎで丸めた燃料だ。</sup><br><sup>The dumplings are made from charcoal powder and water.</sup></p>
<p id="L31">After drying, it can be used in the same way as charcoal, and although it is not as powerful, it holds its heat well and is very fuel efficient.<br><sup>乾燥させた後は木炭と同じように使うことができ、火力こそ強くはないが火の持ちがよく非常に燃費がいい。</sup><br><sup>After drying, it can be used in the same way as charcoal, and although the firepower is not strong, it lasts long and has excellent fuel efficiency.</sup></p>
<p id="L32">Recently, we have been burning charcoal in the mountains, so there is no shortage of materials as we can get a lot of crushed charcoal.<br><sup>最近は山で炭焼きを行っているので、砕けてしまった炭がたくさん手に入るため材料には不自由しない。</sup><br><sup>Recently, charcoal has been baked in the mountains, so you can get a lot of broken charcoal, so there is no shortage of ingredients.</sup></p>
<p id="L33">Children often made charcoal dumplings instead of playing with mud dumplings because the more they made, the more adults praised them.<br><sup>子供たちは作れば作るだけ大人に褒めてもらえるので、泥団子遊びの代わりに炭団作りをよくやっていた。</sup><br><sup>Since children are praised by adults as much as they make them, they often make charcoal balls instead of playing with mud balls.</sup></p>
<p id="L34">Incidentally, the charcoal powder we use now comes from the charcoal that has fallen at the entrance to the charcoal kiln, and from the charcoal that has accumulated at the bottom of the fire extinguishing pots (pots used to put out the fires of carbonized wood) in each house.<br><sup>ちなみに、今使っている木炭の粉は、木炭高炉の入口に落ちていたものをかき集めたものと、各家の火消し壷（炭化した薪の火を消すために入れる壷）の底に溜まったものを持ち寄ったものだ。</sup><br><sup>By the way, the charcoal powder I'm using now is a collection of things that have fallen at the entrance of the charcoal blast furnace and a collection of things that have been stored at the bottom of each house's fire extinguishers.</sup></p>
<p id="L35"><br></p>
<p id="L36">"Master Lise, you can use this too!"<br><sup>「リーゼ様、これも使っていいよ！」</sup><br><sup>"Liese, you can use this, too!"</sup></p>
<p id="L37"><br></p>
<p id="L38">As we were all kneading the dumplings, a boy came running in with a wooden bowl of sloppy brown liquid.<br><sup>皆でせっせと団子をこねていると、１人の男の子が木のボウルにドロドロとした茶色い液体を持って走ってきた。</sup><br><sup>While we were kneading dumplings, a boy came running with a thick brown liquid in a wooden bowl.</sup></p>
<p id="L39">It seemed to have been dissolved in hot water, and steam was rising from it.<br><sup>お湯で溶いてあるらしく、ほかほかと湯気が立ち上っている。</sup><br><sup>It seems to be dissolved in hot water, and the steam is rising.</sup></p>
<p id="L40">Earlier, they had been kneading a coal block using the same liquid that another child had brought with him.<br><sup>先ほどまでも別の子どもが持ってきた同じ液体を使って、炭団をこねていたのだ。</sup><br><sup>He had been kneading coal using the same liquid that another child had brought.</sup></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42">"Wow, thanks. I think I can make a lot of these."<br><sup>「わあ、ありがとう。これならたくさん作れそうだね」</sup><br><sup>"Wow, thank you.I think I can make a lot of them."</sup></p>
<p id="L43"><br></p>
<p id="L44">When Liese smiled at the boy, he flushed and smiled shyly.<br><sup>リーゼが男の子に微笑むと、彼は顔を赤くして照れたように笑った。</sup><br><sup>When Liese smiled at the boy, he blushed and laughed shyly.</sup></p>
<p id="L45">He was already captivated by Lise's smile.<br><sup>すでにリーゼの笑顔の虜になっているようだ。</sup><br><sup>She seems to be already captivated by Liese's smile.</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">"Speaking of which, what is this dissolved stuff?　It smells a little strange."<br><sup>「そういえば　これって何を溶いたものなのかしら？　少し変わった臭いがするけど」</sup><br><sup>"Come to think of it, what is this melted?"It smells a little strange."</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">Zirconia takes the bowl from the boy and sniffs it.<br><sup>ジルコニアが男の子からボウルを受け取り、クンクンと臭いをかぐ。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia receives the bowl from the boy and sniffs it.</sup></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51">"It's bird droppings. My sister Baretta told me that if you dissolve it in water and knead it with charcoal, it makes dumplings that burn well.<br><sup>「根切り鳥の<ruby><rb>糞</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>フン</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>だよ。それを水で溶いて炭と一緒にこねると、よく燃えるお団子になるんだってバレッタお姉ちゃんが言ってた」</sup><br><sup>"It's root-cutting bird droppings.My sister Valletta said that if you melt it in water and knead it with charcoal, it will become a well-burning dumpling."</sup></p>
<p id="L52"><br></p>
<p id="L53">"Yeah, yeah. This was bird shit. ...... Lise?　Are you okay?"<br><sup>「そ、そう。これ鳥の糞だったの……リーゼ？　大丈夫？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, this was bird droppings... Liese? Are you all right?"</sup></p>
<p id="L54"><br></p>
<p id="L55">"It's okay. ......<br><sup>「だ、大丈夫です……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, it's all right..."</sup></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">Lise shivers as she stares at the sticky, semi-raw substance on her hands.<br><sup>手にべっとりと付いた半生状のものを見つめながら、リーゼはぷるぷると震えている。</sup><br><sup>Liese shuddered as she gazed at the semi-living thing on her hand.</sup></p>
<p id="L58">While I was doing this, a village girl came to me.<br><sup>そんなことをやっていると、１人の村娘がやってきた。</sup><br><sup>I was doing that when a village girl came along.</sup></p>
<p id="L59">When she spotted Baretta, she scurried over to her.<br><sup>彼女はバレッタを見つけると、小走りで駆け寄る。</sup><br><sup>When she finds Valletta, she runs up to her.</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">"Valletta, I need you to come over for a minute, are you okay now?"<br><sup>「バレッタ、ちょっと来てもらいたいんだけど、今平気かな？」</sup><br><sup>"Balletta, I'd like you to come for a moment. Are you all right now?"</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63">"Yeah, I'm fine. What's wrong?"<br><sup>「うん、大丈夫だよ。どうかしたの？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, it's all right.What's the matter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">When Baretta asked, the village girl glanced at Lise and then quickly returned her gaze to Baretta.<br><sup>バレッタが問うと村娘はちらりとリーゼに目を向け、すぐに視線をバレッタに戻した。</sup><br><sup>When Valletta asked, the village girl glanced at Liese and immediately turned her eyes back to Valletta.</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">"I'm having a little trouble with my work. It might take a while."<br><sup>「作業でちょっと困ったことがあって。少し時間がかかるかも」</sup><br><sup>"I had a little trouble working on it.It may take some time."</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">"Hmm, okay. Master, I'll be back in a bit.<br><sup>「ん、分かった。親方さん、ちょっと行ってきますね」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, sir.Master, I'll be right back."</sup></p>
<p id="L70"><br></p>
<p id="L71">"Oh. We'll keep an eye on the fire until nightfall, and you can come back then."<br><sup>「おう。夜まで俺たちで火は見ておくから、その時来てくれればいいよ」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, we'll watch the fire until night, so you can come then."</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">"Excuse me. Please."<br><sup>「すみません。お願いします」</sup><br><sup>"Excuse me. Please."</sup></p>
<p id="L74"><br></p>
<p id="L75">Barletta bowed to her master and left with the village girl.<br><sup>バレッタは親方にぺこりと頭を下げると、村娘と去って行った。</sup><br><sup>Valletta bowed to the stable master and left with the village girl.</sup></p>
<p id="L76">Lise stared at the back of the two of them.<br><sup>そんな２人の後姿を、リーゼはじっと見つめている。</sup><br><sup>Liese stared at their backs.</sup></p>
<p id="L77"><br></p>
<p id="L78">"What's wrong?"<br><sup>「どうかした？」</sup><br><sup>"What's the matter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L79"><br></p>
<p id="L80">"No. ......"<br><sup>「いえ……」</sup><br><sup>"No..."</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">Following Liese's gaze, Zirconia also looked at the two as they left.<br><sup>リーゼの視線を追い、ジルコニアも去っていく２人に目を向けた。</sup><br><sup>Following Liese's gaze, Zirconia turned to the two men who were leaving.</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">"With what happened to Kazura, it's no wonder she doesn't think much of us. We'll just have to live with it."<br><sup>「カズラさんのこともあるし、私たちがあまりよく思われてないのは仕方ないわ。割り切るしかないわよ」</sup><br><sup>"There's Kazura, and it can't be helped that we're not very well thought of.I have no choice but to say goodbye."</sup></p>
<p id="L85"><br></p>
<p id="L86">"No, that's not what I meant. ......"<br><sup>「いえ、そういうことではなくて……」</sup><br><sup>"No, that's not the case..."</sup></p>
<p id="L87"><br></p>
<p id="L88">"Lady Lise, if you're cold, would you like to come to my house?"<br><sup>「リーゼ様、寒いなら俺の家に行く？」</sup><br><sup>"Liese, if it's cold, would you like to go to my house?"</sup></p>
<p id="L89"><br></p>
<p id="L90">The boy who was kneading the coal dumplings called out to Lise, who was still looking at them with a puzzled look in her eyes.<br><sup>なおもいぶかしんだ視線を２人の背に向けているリーゼに、炭団をこねていた男の子が声をかけた。</sup><br><sup>A boy who was kneading coal called out to Liese, who was still looking at them suspiciously.</sup></p>
<p id="L91">Liese smiles at the boy.<br><sup>リーゼは男の子に笑顔を向ける。</sup><br><sup>Liese smiles at the boy.</sup></p>
<p id="L92"><br></p>
<p id="L93">"Are you sure?　Wouldn't that be annoying?"<br><sup>「いいの？　迷惑じゃないかな？」</sup><br><sup>"Isn't it okay? Isn't it annoying?"</sup></p>
<p id="L94"><br></p>
<p id="L95">"No, it's not!　I'm fine!"<br><sup>「そんなことないよ！　大丈夫だよ！」</sup><br><sup>"That's not the case!"It's all right!"</sup></p>
<p id="L96"><br></p>
<p id="L97">The boy said and stood up and held out his hand to Lise.<br><sup>男の子はそう言うと立ち上がり、リーゼに手を差し出した。</sup><br><sup>When the boy said so, he stood up and held out his hand to Liese.</sup></p>
<p id="L98">Liese was puzzled for a moment, but quickly took his hand and stood up.<br><sup>リーゼは一瞬きょとんとしたが、すぐにその手を取って立ち上がる。</sup><br><sup>Liese was stunned for a moment, but immediately took her hand and stood up.</sup></p>
<p id="L99"><br></p>
<p id="L100">"Oh, I like that!　I'll hold hands with Miss Lise too!"<br><sup>「あ、いいなー！　私もリーゼ様と手つなぐ！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that's great!"I'll hold hands with Liese too!"</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">"Me too!<br><sup>「ぼくも！」</sup><br><sup>"Me, too!"</sup></p>
<p id="L103"><br></p>
<p id="L104">"Me too!<br><sup>「俺も！」</sup><br><sup>"Me too!"</sup></p>
<p id="L105"><br></p>
<p id="L106">Zirconia followed Liese and the others as they walked happily along.<br><sup>わいわいと歩いていくリーゼたちに続いて、ジルコニアもその後を追う。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia follows Liese's footsteps.</sup></p>
<p id="L107">Then he suddenly looked at the backs of the Barretts in the distance.<br><sup>そしてふと、遠くに見えるバレッタたちの背に目を向けた。</sup><br><sup>and suddenly turned to the backs of the distant Valletas.</sup></p>
<p id="L108"><br></p>
<p id="L109">"...... hmm?"<br><sup>「……うーん？」</sup><br><sup>"...hmm?"</sup></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111">She wondered if there was anything strange about the village girl's behavior, but she couldn't think of anything, so Zirconia twisted her head.<br><sup>村娘の様子に何かおかしなところはあっただろうかと考えるが特に思い当たらず、ジルコニアは首を捻るのだった。</sup><br><sup>I wondered if there was anything strange about the village girl, but I couldn't think of anything in particular, so Zirconia twisted her neck.</sup></p>
<p id="L112"><br></p>
<p id="L113"><br></p>
<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115">"Hey, hey, where are you going?　There's only a storage shed over here. ......"<br><sup>「ね、ねえ、どこに行くの？　こっちには物置小屋しか……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, where are you going?"There's only a shed here..."</sup></p>
<p id="L116"><br></p>
<p id="L117">Baretta called out confusedly to the back of the village girl who was walking fast.<br><sup>早足で進む村娘の背に、バレッタは戸惑った声をかけた。</sup><br><sup>Valletta said in a bewildered voice to the village girl's back, who was walking fast.</sup></p>
<p id="L118">I thought she would be heading for the work shed where they make weapons and machine tools, but she bypassed the work shed and headed for the edge of the village.<br><sup>てっきり武器や工作機械を作っている作業小屋へ向かうのだろうと思っていたのだが、村娘は作業小屋を素通りして村の端へと向かっている。</sup><br><sup>I thought she was heading for the workshop where she was making weapons and machine tools, but the village girl was heading for the edge of the village by passing through the workshop.</sup></p>
<p id="L119"><br></p>
<p id="L120">"Just shut up and follow me.<br><sup>「いいから、黙って付いてきなって」</sup><br><sup>"Don't follow me in silence."</sup></p>
<p id="L121"><br></p>
<p id="L122">The village girl did not answer the question, but walked on with a slight grimace.<br><sup>村娘は問いには答えず、少しにやつきながら歩を進める。</sup><br><sup>The village girl smiled a little and walked on without answering the question.</sup></p>
<p id="L123">After a short walk, they came to an old storage shed where straw was stored.<br><sup>そうして暫し歩き、２人は麦藁が貯蔵されている古い物置小屋へとやってきた。</sup><br><sup>Then they walked for a while and came to the old barn where the straw was stored.</sup></p>
<p id="L124">The hut is large enough to store all the wheat straw in the village, and the roof is high and straw-thatched to keep out the moisture.<br><sup>小屋とはいっても村中の麦藁をすべて貯蔵しているためそこそこ大きく、湿気を抜くために屋根は高く<ruby><rb>藁葺</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>わらぶ</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>きである。</sup><br><sup>Although it was a hut, it was reasonably large because it contained all the straw in the village, and the roof was high and thatched to drain the moisture.</sup></p>
<p id="L125">It's a nice building with ventilation windows, but the pillars are getting a little damaged from being used for so long, and it's time to rebuild.<br><sup>換気窓も付いていてそれなりに立派なのだが、ずっと昔から使われている建物なために柱が少し傷んできており、そろそろ建て直しが必要な頃合だ。</sup><br><sup>"The building has been used for a long time, and the pillars have been damaged a little, so it is time to rebuild."</sup></p>
<p id="L126"><br></p>
<p id="L127">"Barrette."<br><sup>「バレッタ」</sup><br><sup>"Balletta,"</sup></p>
<p id="L128"><br></p>
<p id="L129">She turned around in front of the hut entrance and grabbed Baretta firmly by both shoulders with a serious expression.<br><sup>彼女は小屋の入口の前で振り向くと、真剣な表情でバレッタの両肩をがっしりと掴んだ。</sup><br><sup>She turned around in front of the entrance of the hut and seized Valletta's shoulders with a serious expression.</sup></p>
<p id="L130"><br></p>
<p id="L131">"What?"<br><sup>「な、何？」</sup><br><sup>"What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L132"><br></p>
<p id="L133">"Here's your chance!　Go for it!"<br><sup>「チャンスだよ！　頑張って！」</sup><br><sup>"It's an opportunity! Cheer up!"</sup></p>
<p id="L134"><br></p>
<p id="L135">"What?"<br><sup>「な、何を？」</sup><br><sup>"What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L136"><br></p>
<p id="L137">The village girl took her hand away from the bewildered Baretta and opened the sliding door of the hut.<br><sup>村娘は困惑しているバレッタから手を離すと、小屋の引き戸を開け放った。</sup><br><sup>The village girl let go of her puzzled Valletta and opened the sliding door of the hut.</sup></p>
<p id="L138"><br></p>
<p id="L139">"...... Kazura-san?"<br><sup>「……カズラさん？」</sup><br><sup>"...Mr. Kazura?"</sup></p>
<p id="L140"><br></p>
<p id="L141">Baretta's eyes met with Ichiran's, who was sitting on a large pile of straw inside the hut, and she looked puzzled.<br><sup>小屋の中に大量に積まれた藁に腰をかけている一良と目が合い、バレッタはきょとんとした表情になった。</sup><br><sup>His eyes met with Ichira, who was sitting on a large pile of straw in the hut, and Valletta looked blank.</sup></p>
<p id="L142"><br></p>
<p id="L143">"I'm sorry, Ms. Barrette. I didn't mean to call you so suddenly.<br><sup>「すみません、バレッタさん。急に呼び出しちゃって」</sup><br><sup>"I'm sorry, Mr. Valletta.I called you all of a sudden."</sup></p>
<p id="L144"><br></p>
<p id="L145">"What?　What?"<br><sup>「え？　え？」</sup><br><sup>"What? What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L146"><br></p>
<p id="L147">Unable to swallow the situation, Baretta turned her attention to the village girl.<br><sup>状況が飲み込めず、バレッタは村娘に目を向けた。</sup><br><sup>Unable to understand the situation, Valletta turned to the village girl.</sup></p>
<p id="L148">She met Baretta's eyes and pushed her back into the shed.<br><sup>彼女はバレッタと目が合うと、えいやとその背を押して小屋へと押し込んだ。</sup><br><sup>She made eye contact with Valletta and pushed her back into the hut.</sup></p>
<p id="L149">The door slammed shut, and Baretta turned to Kazuyoshi, confused.<br><sup>ぴしゃりと戸が閉じられ、バレッタは困惑しながらも一良に向き直る。</sup><br><sup>The door closes with a snap, and Valletta turns to Ichira, bewildered.</sup></p>
<p id="L150"><br></p>
<p id="L151">"...... ha!"<br><sup>「……はっ」</sup><br><sup>"...huh,"</sup></p>
<p id="L152"><br></p>
<p id="L153">And the moment her eyes met with Ichiran's, Baretta finally understood the meaning of the village girl's attitude from earlier.<br><sup>そして一良と目が合った瞬間、バレッタは先ほどまでの村娘の態度の意味をようやく理解した。</sup><br><sup>Then, as soon as she met Ichira's eyes, Valletta finally understood the meaning of the village girl's behavior.</sup></p>
<p id="L154">Now I was alone with Kazuyoshi in a storage shed on the outskirts of a dimly lit village.<br><sup>今自分は、薄暗い村はずれの物置小屋に一良と２人きりなのだ。</sup><br><sup>Now I am alone with Ichira in a shed on the outskirts of the dark village.</sup></p>
<p id="L155">I don't know for what reason he was summoned, but in the circumstances, it was a chance of a lifetime.<br><sup>どんな理由で呼び出されたのかは分からないが、状況的には千載一遇のチャンスといえる。</sup><br><sup>I don't know why he was summoned, but it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</sup></p>
<p id="L156">Don't miss this opportunity, she probably wanted to say.<br><sup>この機を逃すな、そう彼女は言いたかったのだろう。</sup><br><sup>Don't miss this opportunity, she must have wanted to say so.</sup></p>
<p id="L157"><br></p>
<p id="L158">"What's wrong?"<br><sup>「どうかしましたか？」</sup><br><sup>"What's the matter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L159"><br></p>
<p id="L160">"No!　It's nothing!"<br><sup>「いえ！　何でもないです！」</sup><br><sup>"No! Nothing!"</sup></p>
<p id="L161"><br></p>
<p id="L162">When Kazuyoshi tilted his head, Baretta gave him an enthusiastic reply.<br><sup>小首を傾げる一良に、バレッタは勢い込んだ返事を返す。</sup><br><sup>Valletta replies enthusiastically to Ichira, who tilts his head slightly.</sup></p>

<p id="L165"><br></p>
<p id="L166">"Yes!"<br><sup>「はいっ！」</sup><br><sup>"Yes!"</sup></p>
<p id="L167"><br></p>
<p id="L168">With a crunchy, awkward movement, Baretta walked up next to Kazuyoshi and sat down on a pile of straw.<br><sup>バレッタはカクカクとしたぎこちない動作で一良の隣に歩み寄ると、積まれている藁の上にすとんと腰を下ろした。</sup><br><sup>Valletta walked up to Ichira with a shaky awkward movement and sat down on the pile of straws.</sup></p>

<p id="L171">"The straw is very warm.

<p id="L172"><br></p>
<p id="L173">"Yes!　It's perfect!"<br><sup>「はいっ！　ばっちりです！」</sup><br><sup>"Yes! It's perfect!"</sup></p>

<p id="L175">"...... Um, are you sure something's wrong?　What's going on?"<br><sup>「……あの、本当にどうかしましたか？　何かあったんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"...what's really wrong with you?What happened?"</sup></p>
<p id="L176"><br></p>
<p id="L177">Kazuyoshi called out in confusion to Baretta, who was acting too suspiciously.<br><sup>あまりにも挙動不審なバレッタに、一良が困惑気味に声をかける。</sup><br><sup>Ichira talks to Valletta, who is so suspicious of his behavior, in a confused manner.</sup></p>

<p id="L182"><br></p>
<p id="L183">Kazuyoshi nodded in confusion at Baretta, who forced herself to breathe and regain her expression.<br><sup>無理矢理呼吸を整えて表情をとりなしたバレッタに、一良は困惑しながらも頷いた。</sup><br><sup>Kazura nodded puzzledly to Valletta, who forced her to breathe and adjust her expression.</sup></p>
<p id="L184"><br></p>
<p id="L185">"So, I'd like to talk to you about something. ...... Last night, Zirconia begged me to give her the same kind of powerful power as the people of Grisea Village. I'm not sure what to do. So I was wondering what to do."<br><sup>「それで、相談したいことなんですが……昨晩、ジルコニアさんに『自分にもグリセア村の人たちのような強力な力を与えて欲しい。そのために食べ物を分けて欲しい』って懇願されたんです。それで、どうしようか悩んでて」</sup><br><sup>"And I'd like to talk to you about something... last night, I told Mr. Zirconia, 'I want you to give me the power of the people of the village of Glyceria.That's why I'd like you to share the food was begged.So I was wondering what to do."</sup></p>
<p id="L186"><br></p>
<p id="L187">"What, food? ......

<p id="L188"><br></p>
<p id="L189">Kazura nodded to Baretta, who said in surprise.<br><sup>驚いたように言うバレッタに、一良が頷く。</sup><br><sup>Kazura nods to Valletta, who says in surprise.</sup></p>
<p id="L190"><br></p>
<p id="L191">"That's what he seems to have figured out on his own. I had given her some shaved ice that I brought from Japan a while ago, and I think that's when she figured it out. I also gave her a bottle of LipoD so that she wouldn't find out, but I think she didn't drink it. Also, she said something about lore.<br><sup>「それが、どうやら自分で気づいてしまったみたいなんです。少し前に日本から持ってきたカキ氷を食べさせたことがあったんですが、その時に勘付いたのかなと。その時はばれないようにリポＤも渡したんですが、それを彼女は飲まなかったんだと思います。あと、言い伝えがどうとかも言ってましたね」</sup><br><sup>"It seems that I have noticed it myself.I had him eat shaved ice brought from Japan a little while ago, and I wonder if he knew it then.At that time, I gave her lipo D so she wouldn't get caught, but I don't think she drank it.And you said something about the legend."</sup></p>
<p id="L192"><br></p>
<p id="L193">"So ...... is it? ...... What did you say, Kazura?"<br><sup>「そう……ですか……カズラさんは、何て答えたんです？」</sup><br><sup>"Is that so...?"What did Kazura say?"</sup></p>
<p id="L194"><br></p>
<p id="L195">"I asked her why she wanted the power and what she was going to do with it. And then she said, "......"<br><sup>「どうして力が欲しいのか、力を得てどうするつもりなのかって聞きました。そしたら、彼女は……」</sup><br><sup>"I asked him why he wanted strength and what he was going to do with it.Then she would..."</sup></p>
<p id="L196"><br></p>
<p id="L197">After saying that much, Kazuyoshi hesitated for a moment and choked on his words.<br><sup>そこまで言って、一良一瞬躊躇したように言葉を詰まらせた。</sup><br><sup>After saying that, he hesitated for a moment and choked his words.</sup></p>
<p id="L198">He felt a little guilty about telling others about his tragic background, which he had heard from Zirconia.<br><sup>ジルコニアから聞いた悲惨な生い立ちを、勝手に他人に話すことに若干の負い目を感じたからだ。</sup><br><sup>I felt a little burdened to tell others about my miserable upbringing from zirconia.</sup></p>

<p id="L200">He quickly regained his composure and opened his mouth.<br><sup>すぐに気を取り直して、口を開いた。</sup><br><sup>He immediately regained his composure and spoke.</sup></p>

<p id="L204">"......"<br><sup>「……」</sup><br><sup>「……」</sup></p>
<p id="L205"><br></p>
<p id="L206">Hearing this, Valletta remembered the time when she had approached Zirconia about manufacturing weapons and had been turned down.<br><sup>それを聞き、バレッタは以前ジルコニアに武器製造の話を持ちかけて断られてしまった時のことを思い出した。</sup><br><sup>When Valletta heard that, she remembered the time when Zirconia had asked her to make weapons and was rejected.</sup></p>
<p id="L207">This was probably the reason why she had refused without a second thought.<br><sup>あの時彼女がにべもなく断ったのは、おそらくこれが理由だったのだろう。</sup><br><sup>This is probably the reason why she refused flatly then.</sup></p>
<p id="L208">The advanced weaponry was certainly attractive, but the physical enhancements would be impossible without Ichiran's help.<br><sup>先進的な武器は確かに魅力的だが、身体能力の強化は一良の協力無しでは不可能だからだ。</sup><br><sup>Advanced weapons are certainly attractive, but strengthening physical abilities is impossible without Ichira's cooperation.</sup></p>
<p id="L209">If Ichira found out that he was manufacturing weapons without permission, taking advantage of Baretta's story, he would lose her trust and would not be able to gain her power.<br><sup>バレッタの話に乗って勝手に武器を製造していることが一良にばれたら、信頼を失って力を得ることができなくなってしまう。</sup><br><sup>If Ichira finds out that he is making weapons on his own, he loses trust and loses power.</sup></p>
<p id="L210">I'm sure that's what she thought, Baretta thought.<br><sup>きっと彼女はそう考えたのだろうと、バレッタは思った。</sup><br><sup>Valletta thought she must have thought so.</sup></p>
<p id="L211"><br></p>
<p id="L212">"I asked him if he knew who he was dealing with, but he said he didn't even know their names. ...... I asked him what he was going to do with the power he gained in such a situation, and he said he was going to kill all of Barbert's people with his own hands if at all possible.

<p id="L213"><br></p>
<p id="L214">After he had spoken that much, Kazuyoshi turned his attention to the closed door.<br><sup>一良はそこまで話すと、閉まっている戸に目を向けた。</sup><br><sup>Ichira said that and turned to the closed door.</sup></p>
<p id="L215">There was a small amount of light leaking through the gap, and the only other source of light was the outside light coming in through the lattice window near the ceiling.<br><sup>その隙間からは僅かに光が漏れており、他の光源は天井近くの格子窓から入ってくる外の光だけだ。</sup><br><sup>There was a little light leaking through the gap, and the only other light source was the outside light coming in through a lattice window near the ceiling.</sup></p>

<p id="L217"><br></p>
<p id="L218">"When we were talking about it, Zirconia-san didn't seem particularly emotional, and I honestly don't know why she said it the way she did. If she really wanted the power, she could have said it in a different way.<br><sup>「その話をしていた時、ジルコニアさんは特に感情的になっているようにも見えなくて、正直どうしてあんな言い方をしたのか分からないんです。どうしても力が欲しいなら、もっと別な言い方があったんじゃないかなって」</sup><br><sup>"When I was talking about that, Zirconia didn't seem particularly emotional, so I honestly don't understand why she said that.If you really wanted strength, I think there would have been a different way of saying it."</sup></p>

<p id="L220">"Yes, ...... why do you say it like that ......?"<br><sup>「そうですね……どうしてそんな言い方……」</sup><br><sup>"Well... why do you say that..."</sup></p>
<p id="L221"><br></p>
<p id="L222">When Kazura spoke, Baretta also tilted her head, unable to read the intent of Zirconia's words.<br><sup>一良の話に、バレッタもジルコニアの言葉の意図が読めずに首を傾げた。</sup><br><sup>At Ichira's story, Valletta tilted her head, unable to read the intentions of Zirconia's words.</sup></p>
<p id="L223">If you're so obsessed with gaining power that you're willing to kick the idea of manufacturing weapons that you've presented, wouldn't it be normal to talk about it in a more sympathetic way?<br><sup>自分が提示した武器製造案を蹴ってまで力を得ることに執着しているのなら、もっと同情を誘うような言い方をするのが普通ではないだろうか。</sup><br><sup>If they are obsessed with gaining strength by rejecting the weapons manufacturing plan they have proposed, it is common to say more sympathetic things.</sup></p>

<p id="L227"><br></p>
<p id="L228">Kazuyoshi said to himself as if he had come to a conclusion as he was talking.<br><sup>話しているうちに自分の中で結論が出たのか、一良が独り言のように言う。</sup><br><sup>Ichira says to himself, "Maybe I've come to a conclusion while I'm talking."</sup></p>

<p id="L289">"...... I don't want to be separated from you anymore."<br><sup>「……もう、離ればなれは嫌です」</sup><br><sup>"...I don't want to leave you anymore."</sup></p>
<p id="L290"><br></p>
<p id="L291">After a while, Valletta muttered to herself.<br><sup>しばらくして、バレッタはぽつりとつぶやいた。</sup><br><sup>After a while Valletta muttered softly.</sup></p>
<p id="L292">He looked up and stared at Kazura's face.<br><sup>顔を上げ、一良の顔をじっと見つめる。</sup><br><sup>He looked up and stared at Ichira's face.</sup></p>

<p id="L300"><br></p>
<p id="L301">When Baretta closed her eyes softly.<br><sup>バレッタがそっと目を閉じた時。</sup><br><sup>When Valletta gently closes her eyes.</sup></p>
<p id="L302">I heard a creaking sound from above me.<br><sup>頭上から「メキメキッ」という木が軋むような音が響いた。</sup><br><sup>There was a creaking sound of trees over my head.</sup></p>

<p id="L306">"...... huh?"<br><sup>「……え？」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>

<p id="L308">As they continued, a flurry of sand fell and splashed on their heads.<br><sup>続けて、ぱらぱらと砂が降り、２人の頭にかかった。</sup><br><sup>Then the sand dripped down and hung on their heads.</sup></p>
<p id="L309">They both looked up at the same time, their faces drawn together at the sight.<br><sup>２人は同時に上を見上げ、その光景に表情を引きつらせた。</sup><br><sup>At the same time, they looked up and looked at the sight with a twitch in their faces.</sup></p>

<p id="L315">A few village girls were looking down at them from the ceiling beams.<br><sup>天井の梁の上から、数人の村娘が２人を見下ろしていた。</sup><br><sup>From the ceiling beam, several village girls looked down at them.</sup></p>
<p id="L316">I don't know how I got inside the hut, but I also see the girl who brought Baretta here earlier.<br><sup>どうやって小屋の中に入ったのか、先ほどバレッタを連れてきた娘の姿もある。</sup><br><sup>There was also a daughter who had just brought Valletta into the hut.</sup></p>

<p id="L318">"Ugh, this sucks. ......"<br><sup>「うう、もう最悪……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, it's the worst..."</sup></p>

<p id="L322">"What are you doing at ......?<br><sup>「な、何やって……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, what are you doing?"</sup></p>

<p id="L324">Just as Kazuyoshi was about to say this, a loud "crack" sounded from the beam the girls were on.<br><sup>一良がそう言いかけた時、彼女らの乗っている梁から、「バキッ」という大きな音が響いた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira was about to say so, a loud bang rang from the beam on which they were riding.</sup></p>

<p id="L326">Everyone in the room stopped moving immediately.<br><sup>その場にいる全員が、ぴたりと動きを止めた。</sup><br><sup>Everyone there stopped completely.</sup></p>
<p id="L327"><br></p>
<p id="L328">"Mi, guys, stay put. ...... Aww!<br><sup>「み、皆、そのまま動かな……あわわわ！」</sup><br><sup>"Well, everybody, just stay where you are you?"I'm in a hurry!"</sup></p>
<p id="L329"><br></p>
<p id="L330">"What the hell?<br><sup>「きゃあああ！？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my!"</sup></p>

<p id="L335">"Look out!"<br><sup>「「危ない！」」</sup><br><sup>"'Danger!'"</sup></p>
<p id="L336"><br></p>
<p id="L337">Kazuyoshi and Baretta shouted at the same time and hugged each other in an attempt to protect each other.<br><sup>一良とバレッタは同時に叫び、お互い庇い合おうとして抱き合うような格好になった。</sup><br><sup>Ichira and Valletta shouted at the same time and hugged each other to protect each other.</sup></p>
