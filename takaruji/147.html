<p id="L1">The morning of a dozen days later.<br><sup>十数日後の朝。</sup><br><sup>Ten days later, in the morning.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">In the workroom of the Narson residence, Kazuyoshi and Zirconia were looking into the de-oil machine.<br><sup>ナルソン邸の作業部屋で、一良はジルコニアと２人で脱油機の中を覗き込んでいた。</sup><br><sup>In the working room of Naruson's house, Ichira and Zirconia were looking into the de-oiler.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">The de-oiler is a cylindrical type with a top cover that opens to let the product in.<br><sup>脱油機は円筒形のもので、上蓋を開けて中に品物を入れる構造のものだ。</sup><br><sup>The de-oiler is cylindrical and has a structure that opens the upper lid and holds things inside.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">When the switch is turned on, the contents rotate at high speed, forcing out the water by centrifugal force.<br><sup>スイッチを入れると中身が高速回転し、遠心力で水分を強制的に絞り出すのである。</sup><br><sup>When the switch is turned on, the contents rotate at high speed and squeeze out moisture by centrifugal force.</sup></p>
<p id="L5">Incidentally, the power is drawn from a generator outside.<br><sup>ちなみに、電源は外に置いてある発電機から引いている。</sup><br><sup>By the way, the power supply is pulled from the generator outside.</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">"There we go. I hope it squeezes well."<br><sup>「これでよし。上手く搾れるといいんだけど」</sup><br><sup>"That's all right. I hope I can squeeze it well."</sup></p>
<p id="L8"><br></p>
<p id="L9">He placed the cloth bag, which was about the size of an armful, into the de-oiler and locked the top cover with a clang.<br><sup>一抱えほどの大きさの布袋を脱油機の中に入れ、ガチン、と上蓋をロックした。</sup><br><sup>I put a bag of cloth about the size of a hug into the degreaser and locked the upper lid with a thud.</sup></p>
<p id="L10">The contents of the cloth bag were steamed and roughly mashed beans.<br><sup>布袋の中身は、蒸してからおおざっぱに潰した豆である。</sup><br><sup>The contents of the cloth bag are roughly crushed beans after steaming.</sup></p>
<p id="L11"><br></p>
<p id="L12">"Does the oil come out of this tube here?"<br><sup>「ここの筒から油が出てくるのですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Is oil coming out of this barrel?"</sup></p>
<p id="L13"><br></p>
<p id="L14">Zirconia crouched down in front of the de-oiler and looked into the tube attached to the bottom for draining oil.<br><sup>ジルコニアは脱油機の前にしゃがみこみ、下部に付いている排油用の筒を覗き込んだ。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia crouched in front of the de-oiler and peered into the oil drain cylinder at the bottom.</sup></p>
<p id="L15">Of course, it was pitch black inside the tube.<br><sup>当然ながら、筒の中は真っ暗だ。</sup><br><sup>Naturally, it was pitch-dark in the barrel.</sup></p>
<p id="L16"><br></p>
<p id="L17">"'Yes, I think it will come out as soon as I start turning it. Would you like me to turn it on, Zirconia?"<br><sup>「ええ、回し始めるとすぐに出てくると思いますよ。ジルコニアさんがスイッチを入れてみますか？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I think it will come out as soon as you start turning it.Will Mr. Zirconia try to switch it on?"</sup></p>
<p id="L18"><br></p>
<p id="L19">"What? Are you sure?"<br><sup>「えっ、いいんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, is that all right?"</sup></p>
<p id="L20"><br></p>
<p id="L21">Kazuyoshi said as he wiped his hands on a towel, and Zirconia sounded a little happy.<br><sup>タオルで手を拭きながら一良が言うと、ジルコニアが少し嬉しそうな声を上げた。</sup><br><sup>As Ichira wiped his hands with a towel, Zirconia uttered a little happy voice.</sup></p>
<p id="L22"><br></p>
<p id="L23">"Here you go. Push that green switch in there."<br><sup>「どうぞどうぞ。そこの緑色のスイッチを押し込んでください」</sup><br><sup>"Go ahead.Please press in the green switch over there."</sup></p>
<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25">Zirconia stood up and came next to Kazuyoshi and put her finger on the switch attached to the top cover of the de-oiler.<br><sup>ジルコニアは立ち上がり、一良の隣に来ると脱油機の上蓋に付いているスイッチに指を添えた。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia stood up, and when she came next to Ichira, she put her finger on the switch on the top cover of the de-oiler.</sup></p>
<p id="L26">Seeing this, a mischievous feeling suddenly appeared in Kazuyoshi's heart.<br><sup>その姿を見て、ふと一良の心にいたずら心が芽生えた。</sup><br><sup>Seeing this, Kazura suddenly developed a sense of mischief in his heart.</sup></p>
<p id="L27"><br></p>
<p id="L28">"Yes, when you push it in, say, 'Pop it in.<br><sup>「そうだ、押し込む時は、『ポチっとな』と掛け声をかけてくださいね」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, please shout 'click' when you squeeze in."</sup></p>
<p id="L29"><br></p>
<p id="L30">What is that?" "What is that? Why are you shouting like that?"<br><sup>「な、何なんですかそれは。どうしてそんな掛け声を？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, what's that?Why are you chanting that?"</sup></p>
<p id="L31"><br></p>
<p id="L32">It's like a spell that says, "May it work. Here you go."<br><sup>「上手くいきますように、というおまじないみたいなものです。さあ、どうぞ」</sup><br><sup>"It's like a charm to wish you all the best.Here you are."</sup></p>
<p id="L33"><br></p>
<p id="L34">"Ha, ha."<br><sup>「は、はあ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L35"><br></p>
<p id="L36">Zirconia turned to the switch and put pressure on her fingers.<br><sup>ジルコニアはスイッチに向き直り、指に力を入れた。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia turned to the switch and applied force to the fingers.</sup></p>
<p id="L37"><br></p>
<p id="L38">"Just click.<br><sup>「ポチっとな」</sup><br><sup>"Just a little,"</sup></p>
<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">As soon as the switch was pressed with such a carefree voice, a low rumbling sound came from the de-oiler.<br><sup>そんな気の抜けた掛け声でスイッチが押されると同時に、低い地鳴りのような音が脱油機から響き出した。</sup><br><sup>At the same time as the switch was pressed by such a despondent chant, a low rumble-like sound came from the de-oiler.</sup></p>
<p id="L41">Zirconia's expression turned anxious as the de-oiler rattled and shook in small increments.<br><sup>ガタガタと音を立てて小刻みに揺れる脱油機に、ジルコニアは不安げな表情になった。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia looked uneasy at the rattling oil-removing machine.</sup></p>
<p id="L42"><br></p>
<p id="L43">"I'm not sure if this is safe or not.　It's shaking like it's about to break, and the sound is ....... Why are you biting back a laugh?　I knew you didn't need that shout!<br><sup>「あ、あの、これって大丈夫なんですか？　なんか壊れそうなくらい揺れてますし、音も……って、なんで笑いを噛み殺してるんですか！？　やっぱり、あの掛け声はいらなかったんでしょう！？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, is this okay?"It's shaking so much that it looks like it's going to break, and the sound... Why are you biting your laughter to death!?I guess you didn't need that chant!"</sup></p>
<p id="L44"><br></p>
<p id="L45">Zirconia blushes when she notices the grin on Ichiran's mouth.<br><sup>一良の口元がニヤついていることに気づき、ジルコニアが顔を赤くする。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia blushes when she notices that Ichira's mouth is grinning.</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">"I'm sorry!　I only meant no offense!　More importantly, look, the oil is coming out!"<br><sup>「す、すみません！　悪気しかなかったんです！　それより、ほら、油が出てきましたよ！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, I'm sorry!"I meant nothing but mischief!More than that, you know, the oil is coming out!"</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">"What do you mean, 'no offense'?" ...... Oh, really!　It's amazing!<br><sup>「悪気『しか』って何です……あ、本当！　すごいです！」</sup><br><sup>"What's the bad intention of 'deer'... Oh, really! It's amazing!"</sup></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51">As I was doing this, oil mixed liquid started to flow out of the oil drain tube.<br><sup>そんなやり取りをしていると、排油用の筒からチョロチョロと油混じりの液体が流れ出してきた。</sup><br><sup>As we communicated like this, liquid mixed with oil flowed out of the drain cylinder.</sup></p>
<p id="L52">It is slightly yellowish in color, similar to the color of salad oil seen in Japan.<br><sup>うっすらと黄色がかっており、日本で見るサラダ油のような色合いをしている。</sup><br><sup>It is slightly yellowish and has a color similar to that of salad oil seen in Japan.</sup></p>
<p id="L53">Zirconia crouched back down in front of the tube and looked into the hole as before.<br><sup>ジルコニアは筒の前に戻ってしゃがみ込み、先ほどのように穴を覗き込んだ。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia crouched back in front of the cylinder and looked into the hole as before.</sup></p>
<p id="L54"><br></p>
<p id="L55">"Oh, it's coming out fast. ...... Normally, it takes more than a full day to squeeze it, so just having one of these will jumpstart efficiency.<br><sup>「おー、どんどん出てきます……普通は丸一日以上かけて搾るので、これが一台あるだけで効率が跳ね上がりますね」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, it keeps coming out... It usually takes more than a whole day to squeeze, so just one of these will increase efficiency."</sup></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">"I don't know if it takes that long. ...... Speaking of which, what kind of beans are these?<br><sup>「そ、そんなに時間がかかるものなんですか……そういえば、これってなんていう豆なんです？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, it takes so long... come to think of it, what kind of beans are these?"</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">"This is a kind of bean called 'winter bean'. The freshly harvested ones are used for oil extraction, and the edible ones are dried in the sun so that they can be preserved.<br><sup>「これは『冬マメ』という種類の豆ですね。収穫したてのものは採油用に使って、食用にするものは保存が利くように天日干しにするんです」</sup><br><sup>"This is a kind of bean called 'winter bean.'Freshly harvested food is used for oil extraction, and edible food is dried in the sun for preservation."</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">"Oh, sun-dried? What kind of food can it be used for?"<br><sup>「へえ、天日干しですか。どんな料理に使えるんです？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, is it sun-dried in the sun?What kind of food can it be used for?"</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63">"When I was living in my hometown, I used to get tired of making bean soup every day in winter. When I was living in my hometown, I used to get tired of making bean soup every day in the winter.<br><sup>「スープとかお粥とか、煮込み料理に使うことが多いですね。故郷で暮らしていた頃は、冬場になると毎日豆のスープばかりで飽き飽きしてました」</sup><br><sup>"It's often used in soup, porridge, and other stewed dishes.When I lived in my hometown, I was tired of eating bean soup every winter."</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">So I kept running the de-oiler for about 15 minutes, and finally no more liquid came out.<br><sup>そうして15分ほど脱油機を回し続け、ようやく液体が出てこなくなった。</sup><br><sup>Then the de-oiler kept running for about 15 minutes until the liquid stopped coming out.</sup></p>
<p id="L66">Stop the de-oiler, open the lid, and remove the beans that have become squeezed residue from inside and transfer them to a vat.<br><sup>脱油機を止めて蓋を開け、中から搾りカスになった豆を取り出して桶に移す。</sup><br><sup>Turn off the oil absorber, open the lid, and remove the beans from the inside and transfer them to the bucket.</sup></p>
<p id="L67">The new beans were packed into bags, set in the de-oiler again, and turned on.<br><sup>新たな豆を袋に詰め、再び脱油機にセットしてスイッチを入れた。</sup><br><sup>Put the new beans in the bag, put them back in the de-oiler, and switch them on.</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">"Is it snowing again today?"<br><sup>「今日も雪が降ってるんですかね？」</sup><br><sup>"Is it snowing again today?"</sup></p>
<p id="L70"><br></p>
<p id="L71">"It seems to be raining. Eira was complaining that she couldn't hang her laundry outside.<br><sup>「降ってるみたいですよ。洗濯物が外に干せなくて大変だって、エイラがぼやいてました」</sup><br><sup>"I think it's raining.Ayla complained that she was having a hard time drying the laundry outside."</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">Since the beginning of the year, it has been snowing almost every day around here.<br><sup>年が明けてからというもの、この辺りではほぼ毎日雪が降り続いていた。</sup><br><sup>Since the beginning of the new year, it has been snowing almost every day around here.</sup></p>
<p id="L74">There are only a few clear, sunny days, and the city has been completely covered in snow.<br><sup>カラっと晴れた日は数えるほどで、街はすっかり雪化粧に染まってしまっている。</sup><br><sup>The streets are covered with snow makeup after countless clear days.</sup></p>
<p id="L75">The temperature was quite low, and it was so cold that my face hurt when I went outside early in the morning.<br><sup>気温もかなり低く、早朝に外へ出ると顔が痛いくらいの寒さだった。</sup><br><sup>The temperature was very low, and it was cold enough to hurt my face when I went out early in the morning.</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">"'Hmm, it's been snowing here all day. Is it like this every year?"<br><sup>「うーん、ここ最近ずっと雪ですね。毎年こんな感じなんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, it's been snowing lately.Is it like this every year?"</sup></p>
<p id="L78"><br></p>
<p id="L79">"No, there's a lot more snow this year than usual. I guess it's a reaction to the terrible heat wave we had in the summer."<br><sup>「いえ、今年は例年に比べてかなり雪が多いですね。夏場は酷い猛暑でしたから、その反動でしょうか」</sup><br><sup>"No, we've had a lot of snow this year compared to usual.It was extremely hot in summer, so I guess it was a reaction."</sup></p>
<p id="L80"><br></p>
<p id="L81">"Oh, I've also heard that the hotter the summer, the colder the winter. ...... Zirconia-san, you seem to be happy. Did something good happen to you?"<br><sup>「ああ、夏の暑さが酷いと、その冬は寒さが厳しくなるって私も聞いたことが……ジルコニアさん、なんか嬉しそうですね。いいことでもあったんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, I've heard that if the summer heat is terrible, the cold will be severe that winter... Zirconia, you look kind of happy.Did something good happen?"</sup></p>
<p id="L82"><br></p>
<p id="L83">Feeling the joy in the tone of his voice, Kazuyoshi turned to look at Zirconia.<br><sup>どことなく声色に楽しげなものを感じ、一良はジルコニアに目を向けた。</sup><br><sup>I felt something pleasant in his voice, and Ichira turned to zirconia.</sup></p>
<p id="L84">Zirconia crouched down and watched the liquid come out, smiling and happy.<br><sup>ジルコニアはしゃがみこんで液体が出てくる様子を眺めながら、にこにこと嬉しそうにしている。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia squatted down and watched the liquid come out, smiling and happy.</sup></p>
<p id="L85"><br></p>
<p id="L86">"I'm so happy that it's this cold and I'm sure we'll get lots of ice. I'm looking forward to summer.<br><sup>「これだけ寒ければ、たくさん氷が取れるだろうなって思ったら嬉しくて。今から夏が楽しみです」</sup><br><sup>"I was so happy to think that if it were this cold, I would be able to get a lot of ice.I'm looking forward to summer now."</sup></p>
<p id="L87"><br></p>
<p id="L88">"That's right. Both the ice house and the ice pond were made well, so it looks promising."<br><sup>「そうですねぇ。氷室も氷池も上手く作れましたし、期待できそうですよね」</sup><br><sup>"Well,I was able to make both ice chambers and ice ponds well, so I think I can look forward to them."</sup></p>
<p id="L89"><br></p>
<p id="L90">The ice pond, built in a mountainous area, had been able to be filled with water well before the snow began to fall.<br><sup>山岳地帯に作られた氷池には、雪が降り始める前にしっかりと水を張ることができていた。</sup><br><sup>Ice ponds built in mountainous areas could be well watered before they began to snow.</sup></p>
<p id="L91">With Zirconia's help, the village at the foot of the mountain has been entrusted with the management of the ice house, so the management system is in place.<br><sup>ジルコニアの口利きでふもとの村に氷室の管理を任せることができたので、管理体制は万全である。</sup><br><sup>With the help of zirconia, the management system is perfect because it was able to entrust the management of the ice chamber to a village at the foot of the mountain.</sup></p>
<p id="L92">If the weather continues to get steadily colder, we will be able to store a lot of ice.<br><sup>このまま順調に寒い日が続けば、たくさんの氷を蓄えることができるだろう。</sup><br><sup>If the cold weather continues smoothly, we will be able to store a lot of ice.</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94">"I'm sure you'll be happy to know that I'm not the only one. We need to start prototyping a refrigerator. ...... Oh yeah, do you want to make an ice chamber for Zirconia-san now?　I need a slightly larger one that can store plenty of ice for shaved ice."<br><sup>「天然氷を使ったかき氷がかかってますもんね。そろそろ冷蔵庫の試作も始めないと……そうだ、ジルコニアさん専用の氷室も今から作りますか？　かき氷用の氷がたっぷり貯蔵できる、少し大きめのやつを」</sup><br><sup>"It's covered with shaved ice made of natural ice.It's about time we started prototypeing the refrigerator... Yes, will we make an ice chamber for Zirconia now?A slightly larger one that can store plenty of shaved ice."</sup></p>
<p id="L95"><br></p>
<p id="L96">"Oh, that's a good idea. ...... makes it sound like I'm a foodie.<br><sup>「あ、それいいですね……って、まるで私が食いしん坊みたいな言いかたですね」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that's nice... as if I were a glutton."</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">"It's like ......, isn't it?　That's the image that's already taken hold of me.<br><sup>「みたいなって……違うんですか？　もうそういうイメージが定着しちゃってるんですけど」</sup><br><sup>"It's like... isn't it?"That's already taken root."</sup></p>
<p id="L99"><br></p>
<p id="L100">"No, you're not!　Please don't fixate on your own strange image!"<br><sup>「ち、違いますよ！　勝手に変なイメージで固めないでください！」</sup><br><sup>"No, it's not!Don't harden yourself with a strange image!"</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">"Oh yeah, I'm kidding. I was just teasing you."<br><sup>「うそうそ、冗談ですって。ちょっとからかっただけですよ」</sup><br><sup>"No, I'm just kidding.I just teased him a little."</sup></p>
<p id="L103"><br></p>
<p id="L104">"Do you really think ...... is a joke anymore?"<br><sup>「もう……本当に冗談って思ってます？」</sup><br><sup>"Now... do you really think it's a joke?"</sup></p>
<p id="L105"><br></p>
<p id="L106">"I know what you're thinking.<br><sup>「思ってますって」</sup><br><sup>"I think so,"</sup></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">"What percentage?"<br><sup>「何割くらい？」</sup><br><sup>"About what percentage?"</sup></p>
<p id="L109"><br></p>
<p id="L110">"It's about ......5.<br><sup>「……５割くらい」</sup><br><sup>"...about fifty percent,"</sup></p>
<p id="L111"><br></p>
<p id="L112">"You're not half serious!"<br><sup>「半分本気じゃないですかっ！」</sup><br><sup>"You're half serious!"</sup></p>
<p id="L113"><br></p>
<p id="L114">Zirconia's cheeks puffed up in anger, but Kazura admonished her with a laugh.<br><sup>頬を膨らませて怒るジルコニアを、一良が笑いながら諫める。</sup><br><sup>Ichira laughs and remonstrates Zirconia, who gets angry with her cheeks bulging.</sup></p>
<p id="L115">As I was doing this, the door to my room opened and Isaac came in.<br><sup>そんなことをしていると、部屋の扉が開いてアイザックが入ってきた。</sup><br><sup>As I was doing that, the door of the room opened and Isaac came in.</sup></p>
<p id="L116">He was holding a large wooden box that looked like it could hold a hundred pounds, with steam rising from the top lid.<br><sup>一抱えもありそうな大きな木箱を抱え、上蓋からはほかほかと湯気が立っている。</sup><br><sup>There was a big wooden box in his arms, and steam was rising from the top lid.</sup></p>
<p id="L117"><br></p>
<p id="L118">"Dear Kazura, I have brought you some more beans. How is the oil pressing going?"<br><sup>「カズラ様、追加の豆をお持ちいたしました。油搾りは順調ですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Kazura, I have brought you some extra beans.Is the oiling going well?"</sup></p>
<p id="L119"><br></p>
<p id="L120">"Yes, it's going well. We've been able to press the oil with Baretta's screw press, and it looks like mass production of oil will go well.<br><sup>「ええ、順調ですよ。バレッタさんのスクリュープレスでも搾れてますし、油の量産は上手くいきそうです」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, it's going well.It's squeezed by Valletta's screw press, and it looks like mass production of oil will work."</sup></p>
<p id="L121"><br></p>
<p id="L122">A prototype of the screw press designed by Barretta has been completed and is still in operation.<br><sup>バレッタが設計したスクリュープレスは試作機が完成しており、今現在も絶賛稼働中だ。</sup><br><sup>The prototype of the screw press designed by Valletta has been completed and is still in high praise.</sup></p>
<p id="L123">Due to the large amount of beans harvested, the usual method of pressing (placing the beans in a wooden box with a gap in between and placing a stone or other weight on top to press out the oil) is not enough to extract the oil in time, so we are rushing to produce additional screw presses.<br><sup>豆の収穫量がかなり多かったため、普段行われているような圧搾（隙間の開いた木箱に豆を入れ、上に石などの重しを載せて油を搾る）では油の抽出が間に合わないので、大急ぎで追加のスクリュープレスの生産に取り掛かっている状況である。</sup><br><sup>Due to the large harvest of soybeans, additional screw presses are being produced in a hurry because it is not possible to extract oil in time by squeezing beans into a wooden box with a gap and putting stones on it.</sup></p>
<p id="L124">In the meantime, they are using the de-oiler that Kazuyoshi brought with him to fill in the gaps.<br><sup>その間の穴埋めとして、一良が持ってきた脱油機を使っているというわけだ。</sup><br><sup>In other words, he uses a de-oiler brought by Ichira to fill the gap.</sup></p>
<p id="L125"><br></p>
<p id="L126">"Okay, that's about it."<br><sup>「よし、こんなもんかな」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I guess it'said he.</sup></p>
<p id="L127"><br></p>
<p id="L128">When the liquid has stopped draining, stop the de-oiler, open the lid and remove the pressed waste.<br><sup>液体の排出が止まったので脱油機を止め、フタを開けて搾りカスを取り出す。</sup><br><sup>Since the liquid has stopped discharging, stop the degreasing machine and open the lid to remove the extruded residue.</sup></p>
<p id="L129">I took the cloth bag filled with beans from Isaac and put it in the de-oiler.<br><sup>アイザックから豆を詰めた布袋を受け取り、脱油機に入れた。</sup><br><sup>I received a cloth bag filled with beans from Isaac and put it in the de-oiler.</sup></p>
<p id="L130">When the switch was turned on and the liquid began to drain, Isaac let out an "oh" at the sight.<br><sup>スイッチを入れて液体の排出が始まると、その光景にアイザックが「おお」と声を上げた。</sup><br><sup>When the switch was turned on and the liquid began to drain, Isaac cried out at the sight.</sup></p>
<p id="L131"><br></p>
<p id="L132">"I didn't know it was this easy to press oil. ......<br><sup>「こんなに簡単に油が搾れるとは……」</sup><br><sup>"I can't believe it's so easy to squeeze oil..."</sup></p>
<p id="L133"><br></p>
<p id="L134">"It's amazing. I can press oil hundreds of times faster than usual with just this one machine.<br><sup>「すごいわよね。これ１台で、普段の数百倍は早く油が搾れそう」</sup><br><sup>"That's great.With this one, I can squeeze oil hundreds of times faster than usual."</sup></p>
<p id="L135"><br></p>

<p id="L196">"It's not impossible, but if they break the truce in such a manner, Balbert's diplomatic credibility will be ruined.

<p id="L221">"We can make it. If there is an emergency, we will be able to compulsorily call up the reserves and rush to the fort within a few days, though it will be a hastily assembled army.

<p id="L250">Narson was about to say that much, when he stopped speaking with an expression of surprise.<br><sup>ナルソンはそこまで言いかけて、しまった、といった表情で言葉を止めた。</sup><br><sup>Narson stopped with an expression on his face, saying, "I'm done."</sup></p>
<p id="L251">Zirconia still kept her eyes on her lap.<br><sup>ジルコニアは相変わらず、膝に視線を落としたままだ。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia is still looking down on her knees.</sup></p>
<p id="L252"><br></p>
<p id="L253">"...... Mr. Narson?"<br><sup>「……ナルソンさん？」</sup><br><sup>"...Mr. Narson?"</sup></p>
<p id="L254"><br></p>
<p id="L255">"No, no, I'm sorry. Anyway, we will pay more attention to Balbert's movements. As for our response to the other side, we will offer to increase security near the border."<br><sup>「い、いえ、申し訳ございません。とにかく、バルベールの動向にはより注意をはらうようにいたします。相手方への対応は、国境付近の警備を増強する旨を提示することとします」</sup><br><sup>"No, no, I'm sorry, but I'll pay more attention to what's going on with Valve.In dealing with the other party, we will present that we will increase security near the border."</sup></p>
<p id="L256"><br></p>
<p id="L257">"What about the claim for compensation?"<br><sup>「賠償金の請求についてはどうします？」</sup><br><sup>"What about the claim?"</sup></p>
<p id="L258"><br></p>
<p id="L259">"I'm going to push it. I've been presented with no evidence whatsoever."<br><sup>「突っぱねます。証拠も何も提示されていないので」</sup><br><sup>"I'll turn it down.There is no evidence or anything."</sup></p>
<p id="L260"><br></p>
<p id="L261">"I understand. ...... Um, if we assume that Balbert is going to ignore the armistice and attack us, how soon do you think it will be, Mr. Narson?"<br><sup>「分かりました。……あの、もしもの話なんですが、バルベールが休戦協定を無視して攻撃してくると仮定した場合、ナルソンさんはどれくらいの時期になると考えているんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"All right. ... you know, if Barbert were to attack in defiance of the Armistice Agreement, how long would Mr. Narson think it would it be?"</sup></p>
<p id="L262"><br></p>
<p id="L263">"It is unlikely that they will break the truce itself, but if they do, it will be after the summer of a year from now at the earliest. According to the information I've received, the regent was just replaced last summer, and one of the new regents seems to be a man who values the opinions of the citizens more than the Senate. Under such circumstances, I don't think they will take any drastic action.<br><sup>「休戦協定を破ること自体可能性は低いとは思いますが、破るとしたら早くても１年後の夏以降でしょう。入ってきている情報では執政官が昨年の夏頃に交代したばかりですし、新しい執政官の１人は元老院よりも市民の意見を重視する人物のようです。そんな状況のなかで彼らが大それた行動を起こすとは思えません」</sup><br><sup>"I don't think it's possible to break the armistice itself, but if so, it will be after summer at the earliest.According to incoming information, the magistrate has just been replaced around last summer, and one of the new magistrates seems to place more importance on citizens' opinions than on the Senate.I don't think they're going to make a big move in such a situation."</sup></p>
<p id="L264"><br></p>
<p id="L265">"I see. ......"<br><sup>「なるほど……」</sup><br><sup>"I see..."</sup></p>

<p id="L267">Kazuyoshi nodded and glanced at Zirconia, who was nodding next to him.<br><sup>一良は頷きながら、隣でうなだれているジルコニアをちらりと見やった。</sup><br><sup>Ichira nodded and glanced at the zirconia hanging next to him.</sup></p>
<p id="L268">He kept his mouth shut, as if he had something to say but was holding back.<br><sup>何か言いたいことがあるのに我慢しているように、ぐっと口を閉ざしている。</sup><br><sup>He kept silent as if he had put up with something to say.</sup></p>
<p id="L269">I'm pretty sure he's not happy with the way the story is going.<br><sup>話の流れに納得していないのは間違いないだろう。</sup><br><sup>There is no doubt that you are not satisfied with the flow of the story.</sup></p>
<p id="L270"><br></p>
<p id="L271">"Jill, there may be some dissatisfaction, but even if only a few citizens are recruited, it will spread unnecessary anxiety throughout the country. The fever that has been building up for the reconstruction will quickly cool down. Please understand."<br><sup>「ジル、不満はあるかもしれんが、たとえ一部の市民だけだとしても徴募などしたら、国中にいらぬ不安を広げてしまうことになる。復興に盛り上がっている熱も一気に冷めてしまうだろう。分かってくれ」</sup><br><sup>"Jill, you may be dissatisfied, but even if only a few citizens are recruited, it will spread uneasiness throughout the country.The fever for reconstruction will soon cool down.Please understand."</sup></p>
<p id="L272"><br></p>
<p id="L273">When Narson said this, Zirconia took a small breath and then looked up.<br><sup>ナルソンがそう言うと、ジルコニアは小さく息をついてから顔を上げた。</sup><br><sup>When Narson said so, Zirconia took a small breath and looked up.</sup></p>
<p id="L274"><br></p>
<p id="L275">"...... It's okay. I know. I'm sorry I went overboard."<br><sup>「……大丈夫よ。分かってる。出過ぎたことを言ってごめんなさい」</sup><br><sup>"...it's all right.I know.I'm sorry to have gone too far."</sup></p>
<p id="L276"><br></p>
<p id="L277">She says with a slightly annoyed smile, and Narson takes a breath as if to say, "Oh dear.<br><sup>少し困ったように微笑みながら言う彼女に、ナルソンは「やれやれ」といったふうに息をついている。</sup><br><sup>Narson breathes "Oh my gosh," as she smiles a little troubledly.</sup></p>
<p id="L278">Despite these two, Kazuyoshi felt an uneasy feeling in his heart.<br><sup>そんな２人をよそに、一良の胸にはすっきりしないものがうずまいていた。</sup><br><sup>Apart from these two, Ichira's heart was filled with something uncomfortable.</sup></p>
