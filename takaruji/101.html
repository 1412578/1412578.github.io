<p id="L1">The next morning.<br><sup>次の日の朝。</sup><br><sup>The next morning.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">Kazura and his friends were led by Zirconia to an abandoned farm with wagons loaded with materials and artisans.<br><sup>一良たちはジルコニアに案内され、資材を積んだ荷馬車や職人たちとともに放棄された農場へとやってきた。</sup><br><sup>Ichira and his colleagues were guided by Zirconia to the abandoned farm with carts and craftsmen loaded with materials.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">The farm was deserted, with grass growing all over the place, but the area was flat and suitable for building ice ponds.<br><sup>農場は辺り一面に草が生い茂って荒れ果てているが、一帯は平地となっていて氷池を造るには適している。</sup><br><sup>The farm is overgrown with grass, but the whole area is flat and suitable for ice ponds.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">He said that all the stones in the soil had been removed, so it would be easy to dig up the soil.<br><sup>土の中の石は全て除去されているとのことなので、土を掘り起こすのも容易だろう。</sup><br><sup>It is said that all the stones in the soil have been removed, so it will be easy to dig up the soil.</sup></p>
<p id="L5"><br></p>
<p id="L6">The road to the river is flat, and I think we can easily draw water using a water wheel. We only need to dig a small drainage ditch against the slope, so I think this is the best place.<br><sup>「川までの道も平坦ですし、水車を使えば水も簡単に引けると思います。排水用の溝も斜面に向かって少し掘るだけでいいので、この場所が最適かと思いますが」</sup><br><sup>"The road to the river is flat, and if you use a waterwheel, you can easily draw water.I think this is the best place to dig a little bit toward the slope for drainage."</sup></p>
<p id="L7"><br></p>
<p id="L8">It's a nice place. It's a little far from the surrounding trees, and if we build a fence, it will be harder for leaves to get in.<br><sup>「ここはいい場所ですね。周辺の木とも少し離れているし、柵を作れば落ち葉も入りにくくできそうです」</sup><br><sup>"This is a nice place.It's a little far from the surrounding trees, and if you build a fence, it'll be hard for fallen leaves to enter."</sup></p>
<p id="L9"><br></p>
<p id="L10">As he answered, Kazuyoshi glanced sideways at Zirconia, stealing a look at her face.<br><sup>一良は答えながら、横目でちらりとジルコニアの顔を盗み見た。</sup><br><sup>Ichira glanced sideways at Zirconia's face, answering.</sup></p>
<p id="L11">Zirconia looked the same as usual, not particularly glum.<br><sup>ジルコニアはいつもと変わらない様子で、特に暗い顔をしているといったことはない。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia looks the same as usual and doesn't look particularly dark.</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">Last night, about half an hour after that, the zirconia finally came back.<br><sup>昨晩、あれから30分ほどしてようやくジルコニアは戻ってきた。</sup><br><sup>Last night, about half an hour after that, zirconia came back.</sup></p>
<p id="L14">After that, he immediately went into his tent, and apparently ate his meals there as well.<br><sup>その後、すぐに自分の天幕に入ってしまい、食事も天幕内でとったらしい。</sup><br><sup>After that, he immediately entered his tent and ate in it.</sup></p>
<p id="L15">Kazuyoshi and Lise had been worried that he might be depressed, but it seemed that their fears were unfounded.<br><sup>気落ちしていたりするのだろうかと一良とリーゼは心配していたのだが、それは杞憂で済んだようだ。</sup><br><sup>Ichira and Liese were worried that they might be discouraged, but it seems that they were just groundless.</sup></p>
<p id="L16"><br></p>
<p id="L17">So let's get the work orders out of the way.<br><sup>「それでは、早速作業指示を出してしまいましょうか」</sup><br><sup>"Then shall I give you the work instructions at once?"</sup></p>
<p id="L18"><br></p>
<p id="L19">Kazuyoshi said and began to explain the work procedure to the craftsmen who were following him.<br><sup>一良はそう言うと、ついてきていた職人たちに作業手順を説明し始めた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira said so, he began to explain the work procedures to the craftsmen who were following him.</sup></p>
<p id="L20">The first step is to produce mortar.<br><sup>まずはモルタルの製造方法だ。</sup><br><sup>The first is the manufacturing method of mortar.</sup></p>
<p id="L21">He demonstrated how to make mortar right in front of his eyes, and continued his explanation while carefully answering the questions of the craftsmen who asked him this and that.<br><sup>実際に目の前でモルタル作りを実演し、あれこれと質問してくる職人たちに丁寧に答えながら説明を続ける。</sup><br><sup>In fact, he demonstrated mortar making in front of his eyes and explained it politely to the craftsmen who asked him this and that.</sup></p>
<p id="L22"><br></p>
<p id="L23">In this way, the finished mortar should be carefully applied with a spatula to flatten it. The lime is poisonous if inhaled, so please work with a cloth wrapped around your mouth."<br><sup>「こんな感じで、出来上がったモルタルはヘラを使って丁寧に塗って平らにしてください。石灰は吸い込むと毒なので、口には布を巻いて作業してくださいね」</sup><br><sup>"Please apply the finished mortar carefully with a spatula and make it flat.Lime is poisonous when inhaled, so please work with a cloth wrapped around your mouth."</sup></p>
<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25">Is the lime used in the material to repel insects?"<br><sup>「材料に使っている石灰は虫除けのためですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Is the lime used in the ingredients used to ward off insects?"</sup></p>
<p id="L26"><br></p>
<p id="L27">No, if you mix lime with sand or soil and knead it with water, you get mortar that hardens over time.<br><sup>「いえ、石灰を砂や土と混ぜて水でこねると、時間とともに固まるモルタルができるんです」</sup><br><sup>"No, if you mix lime with sand and soil and knead it with water, you'll get mortar that hardens over time."</sup></p>
<p id="L28"><br></p>
<p id="L29">If it rains, won't the mortar melt and not set?"<br><sup>「雨が降ったらモルタルが溶けて固まらないのではないですか？」</sup><br><sup>"If it rains, the mortar won't melt and harden, will it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L30"><br></p>
<p id="L31">This mortar is a special kind of mortar that hardens well even in water. If you mix in some ceramic pieces, you can make a hydraulic mortar. However, if it rains like a downpour, the mortar will be covered with raindrops, so if that happens, please stop working. If it's just a light rain, you can continue working.<br><sup>「このモルタルはたとえ水の中でもしっかりと固まる特殊なものです。陶器片を混ぜると水硬性のモルタルが作れるんです。とはいっても土砂降りのような雨だとモルタルが雨粒でぼこぼこになってしまうので、そういった場合は作業を中断してください。小雨程度なら作業を続けても大丈夫です」</sup><br><sup>"This mortar is a special thing that hardens even in water.You can make hydraulic mortar by mixing pieces of pottery.However, if it rains cats and dogs, the mortar will become rough due to raindrops, so please stop working in such cases.It's okay to continue working if it's only a little rain."</sup></p>
<p id="L32"><br></p>
<p id="L33">That's how I finished explaining the mortar.<br><sup>そんなこんなでモルタルの説明を終えた。</sup><br><sup>That's how I finished explaining mortar.</sup></p>
<p id="L34">Kazuyoshi explained that if you mix the ceramic pieces, you can make a hydraulic mortar, which is due to the effect of the artificial pozzolan.<br><sup>陶器片を混ぜると水硬性のモルタルが作れる、と一良が説明したが、これは人工ポゾランの効果によるものだ。</sup><br><sup>Ichira explained that mixing pieces of pottery can make hydraulic mortar, which is due to the effect of artificial pozzolan.</sup></p>
<p id="L35">The soluble silica in the baked clay reacts with the calcium hydroxide in the lime mixed with water, causing something called the pozzolanic reaction.<br><sup>焼いた粘土に含まれている可溶性シリカと、水を混ぜた石灰の水酸化カルシウムが反応し、ポゾラン反応というものを起こす。</sup><br><sup>The soluble silica in baked clay reacts with calcium hydroxide in lime mixed with water, causing a pozzolan reaction.</sup></p>
<p id="L36">This makes an aerated mortar, which is originally dried to cure, into a hydraulic mortar, which also cures in water.<br><sup>これにより、本来は乾燥させて硬化させる気硬性モルタルが、水中でも硬化する水硬性モルタルとなる。</sup><br><sup>Accordingly, the air-hardening mortar originally dried and cured becomes a hydraulic mortar hardened even in water.</sup></p>
<p id="L37">It is similar to the "Roman concrete" used in ancient Rome.<br><sup>古代ローマで使われていた『ローマン・コンクリート』と同様のものだ。</sup><br><sup>It is similar to the Roman Concrete used in ancient Rome.</sup></p>
<p id="L38">The same can be made by mixing pumice, volcanic ash, or volcanic soil.<br><sup>軽石や火山灰、火山性土を混ぜても同様のもを作ることができる。</sup><br><sup>The same can be made by mixing pumice, volcanic ash and volcanic soil.</sup></p>
<p id="L39">Zirconia once told me that obsidian is rarely found in this mountainous area, so if we look for it, we will probably find volcanic soil.<br><sup>この山岳地帯では稀に黒曜石が産出すると以前ジルコニアが言っていたので、探せば火山性土を見つけることができるだろう。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia used to say that obsidian is rare in this mountainous area, so volcanic soil can be found if you look for it.</sup></p>
<p id="L40">However, there is no need to search all over the mountain because there are a lot of pottery pieces dumped in the suburbs of Isteria.<br><sup>といっても、イステリア郊外には陶器片が大量に捨てられているので、わざわざ山の中を探し回る必要はないのだが。</sup><br><sup>There is no need, however, to go all the way through the mountains, because there are so many pieces of pottery thrown away in the suburbs of Estelia.</sup></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42">The next step is the filtration system. If the material is contaminated, it will be useless.<br><sup>「次にろ過装置ですが、使う石や木材はきれいに洗うようにしてください。材料が汚れていたら元も子もありませんから」</sup><br><sup>"Next, regarding the filtration system, please make sure to wash the stones and wood used.If the ingredients are dirty, it won't cost anything."</sup></p>
<p id="L43"><br></p>
<p id="L44">The filtration system used here is to remove fine debris from the river water sent out by the water wheel.<br><sup>ここで用いるろ過装置とは、水車が送り出してくる川の水から細かいゴミを取り除くためのものだ。</sup><br><sup>The filtration system used here is to remove fine garbage from the river from the waterwheel.</sup></p>
<p id="L45">A small, removable filtration system with boulders in a square wooden basket is the first stage, and a mortar filtration system about the size of a bath tub is installed as the second stage.<br><sup>四角い木のカゴの中に玉石を入れた脱着可能な小型のろ過装置を１段目とし、２段目として風呂の湯船くらいの大きさのモルタル製のろ過装置を設置する。</sup><br><sup>A small detachable filter containing jade and stone in a square wooden basket is used as the first stage, and a mortar filter about the size of a bathtub is installed as the second stage.</sup></p>
<p id="L46">The second stage of the filtration system is made of large stones, cobble gravel, and river sand, which in turn are laid down from the bottom.<br><sup>２段目のろ過装置は、大きな石、玉砂利、川砂を、順番に下から敷き詰めて作る。</sup><br><sup>The second stage of filtration is made by laying large stones, gravel and river sand from the bottom in turn.</sup></p>
<p id="L47">Zirconia and Liese were also listening to these explanations with serious expressions.<br><sup>それらの説明を、ジルコニアとリーゼも真剣な表情で聞いていた。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia and Liese listened with serious expressions.</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">He then instructed them on the size of the ice pond and the depth to dig, and finished explaining everything.<br><sup>その後、氷池の大きさや掘る深さを指示し、全ての説明を終えた。</sup><br><sup>After that, he instructed the size and depth of the ice pond and finished explaining everything.</sup></p>
<p id="L50">The depth of the ice pond will be a little over a meter, and the bottom and walls will be made of mortar.<br><sup>氷池の深さは１メートルちょっとにする予定で、底も壁もモルタル製にする。</sup><br><sup>The depth of the ice pond will be just over one meter, and the bottom and walls will be made of mortar.</sup></p>
<p id="L51">It will take some days to complete the project as it takes time to dig the ground and dry the mortar.<br><sup>地面を掘るのにもモルタルを乾かすのにも時間がかかるので、完成までにはある程度日数がかかるだろう。</sup><br><sup>It takes time to dig and dry the mortar, so it will take some days to complete.</sup></p>
<p id="L52"><br></p>
<p id="L53">Then get to work. You're going to be staying here for a while, so if there are any supplies you need, tell them now."<br><sup>「それでは、作業を開始してください。しばらくここに滞在してもらうことになるので、必要な物資があれば今のうちに言っておくように」</sup><br><sup>"Then start working on it'I'll have you stay here for a while, so if you need any supplies, I'll tell you before long."</sup></p>
<p id="L54"><br></p>
<p id="L55">When Kazuyoshi said this, one of the craftsmen raised his hand.<br><sup>一良がそう言うと、職人の中の１人が手を挙げた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira said so, one of the craftsmen raised his hand.</sup></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">I heard that there is an abandoned village up the road.　I would like to use the pots, hoes and other tools if they are still there.<br><sup>「この先に廃村があると聞いたのですが、そこの建物を解体して薪として使ってもよろしいでしょうか？　鍋や鍬などの道具も残っていれば使いたいのですが」</sup><br><sup>"I heard that there is an abandoned village ahead, but can I tear down the building and use it as firewood?If there are any tools left, I would like to use them."</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">No, it's ......."<br><sup>「いや、それは……」</sup><br><sup>"No, that's..."</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">I don't mind. Use it as you like."<br><sup>「構わないわ。好きに使って」</sup><br><sup>"I don't mind. Do as you please."</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63">When Kazuyoshi tried to refuse softly, Zirconia, who was next to him, opened her mouth.<br><sup>一良がやんわりと断ろうとすると、隣にいたジルコニアが口を開いた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira tried to say no gently, Zirconia, who was next to him, spoke.</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">There are a lot of graves over there, so be careful not to step on them or destroy them. If you can afford it, please take care of the graves."<br><sup>「ただ、あそこにはお墓が沢山あるから、それらを踏みつけたりして荒らさないように注意してね。余裕があったら、お墓の手入れもしてあげてちょうだい」</sup><br><sup>"But there are many graves there, so be careful not to trample on them and ravage them.If you can afford it, please take care of my grave."</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">"Yes, sir."<br><sup>「かしこまりました」</sup><br><sup>"Very well,"</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">The artisans bowed to Zirconia and called together the workers who were waiting in a remote area.<br><sup>職人たちはジルコニアに一礼すると、離れた場所で待機していた労働者たちを呼び集めた。</sup><br><sup>The craftsmen saluted Zirconia and gathered the workers waiting in the distance.</sup></p>
<p id="L70">Soon after, a large scale digging of the ice pond began.<br><sup>ほどなくして、大掛かりな氷池掘り作業が開始された。</sup><br><sup>Soon, large-scale ice pond digging began.</sup></p>
<p id="L71"><br></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73"><br></p>
<p id="L74">That night.<br><sup>その日の夜。</sup><br><sup>That night.</sup></p>
<p id="L75">Baretta was in the mountains, a few kilometers away from the encampment where Ichiran and the others were spending their time.<br><sup>一良たちが過ごしている野営地から数キロ離れた山の中に、バレッタはいた。</sup><br><sup>Valletta was in the mountains a few kilometers away from the camp where Ichira and his colleagues lived.</sup></p>
<p id="L76">Baretta was sitting in front of a domed charcoal kiln in the middle of a quiet mountain, hugging her knees and paddling her boat slowly.<br><sup>バレッタは静まり返った山の中、こんもりと盛り上がったドーム状の<ruby><rb>炭窯</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>すみがま</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>の前で膝を抱えて座り、こっくりこっくりと舟をこいでいた。</sup><br><sup>Valletta sat with her knees in front of a thick dome-shaped charcoal kiln in the quiet mountains, rowing steadily.</sup></p>
<p id="L77">Right next to me, on the moshiro, a village girl who I always get along with is lying down with her cloak over her head.<br><sup>すぐ隣に敷かれたムシロの上では、いつも仲良くしている村娘がマントを被って横になっている。</sup><br><sup>On the mushroom next door, a village girl, who was always close to her, lay down in a cloak.</sup></p>
<p id="L78"><br></p>
<p id="L79">The charcoal kiln is about one meter and fifty centimeters high, rounded, and has a single chimney for smoke exhaust.<br><sup>炭窯は１メートル５０センチほどの高さで丸みを帯びており、排煙用の煙突が１つ付いている。</sup><br><sup>The charcoal kiln is about 1.50 centimeters high and round and has a chimney for exhausting smoke.</sup></p>
<p id="L80">The upper part of the building was covered with a thick layer of earth, and the entrance was framed with bricks.<br><sup>上部はのっぺりとした土で覆われ、入り口の部分はレンガで枠組みがされていた。</sup><br><sup>The top part was covered with flat earth and the entrance part was framed with bricks.</sup></p>
<p id="L81">All of the materials used in the charcoal kiln were created by Baretta in cooperation with the villagers.<br><sup>炭窯に使われている材料は、全てバレッタが村人たちと協力して作り上げたものだ。</sup><br><sup>All the ingredients used in the charcoal kiln were made by Valletta in cooperation with the villagers.</sup></p>
<p id="L82"><br></p>
<p id="L83">The bricks used are sun-dried bricks made of clay obtained from the mountains, placed in wooden molds, and dried in the sun to harden.<br><sup>用いているレンガは、山で手に入れた粘土を木製の型に入れて天日干しをして固めた日干しレンガだ。</sup><br><sup>The bricks used are sun-dried bricks made from clay obtained from mountains in wooden molds.</sup></p>
<p id="L84">I used them to make the outer frame of the kiln, and laid the logs that I had cut from around the area on the inside.<br><sup>それを使って窯の外枠を作り、内側にその辺で切ってきた原木を敷き詰めた。</sup><br><sup>Using it, the outer frame of the kiln was made and the wood cut around it was laid on the inside.</sup></p>
<p id="L85">We mixed lime and sand brought from the village to make mortar, and then mixed mountain soil into the mortar and kneaded it together to make what we called kamatsuchi.<br><sup>村から持ってきた石灰と砂を混ぜ合わせてモルタルを作り、それに山の土を混ぜ込んでこね合わせ、カマツチと呼ばれるものを作った。</sup><br><sup>The lime and sand brought from the village were mixed together to make mortar, and the soil from the mountains was mixed together to make something called kamatsuchi.</sup></p>
<p id="L86">It took several days to build the kiln, covering the entire surface with dumplings of kamatsutsi that were pounded onto the logs and then beaten with a stick to tighten the soil.<br><sup>団子状にしたカマツチを原木の上から叩きつけるようにして全面を覆い、棒で叩いて土を締め、数日かかって窯を作り上げた。</sup><br><sup>It took a few days to make a kiln by pounding a dumpling-shaped katsuchi from the top of a log, covering the whole surface, and beating it with sticks to tighten the soil.</sup></p>
<p id="L87"><br></p>
<p id="L88">The kiln was finished about seven days ago, and now we are building a fire at the entrance of the kiln to accelerate the drying process.<br><sup>窯が出来上がったのが今から７日ほど前の話で、今は窯の乾燥を促進させるために、窯の入り口で火を焚いているところだ。</sup><br><sup>The kiln was built about seven days ago, and now it is burning at the entrance of the kiln to promote drying.</sup></p>
<p id="L89">With no rain at all and extremely dry air, we will be able to dry the kiln fairly quickly.<br><sup>全く雨が降らず極度に乾燥している空気のおかげで、かなり早く窯を乾かすことができるだろう。</sup><br><sup>The extremely dry air without any rain will allow the kiln to dry quite quickly.</sup></p>
<p id="L90">As a precaution, pillars have been erected around the kiln and a roof has been installed to protect it from rain.<br><sup>念のため、窯の周囲には柱が立てられ、雨が降っても大丈夫なように屋根が取り付けられている。</sup><br><sup>As a precaution, pillars are installed around the kiln and roofs are installed to prevent rain.</sup></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">There is a pile of firewood from the village nearby, which we plan to use to make charcoal once the kiln is dry.<br><sup>近くには村から持ってきた薪が山積みにされており、炭窯が乾燥したらその薪を使って炭を焼く予定だ。</sup><br><sup>Nearby, there is a pile of firewood from the village, and when the charcoal kiln dries, it will be used to bake charcoal.</sup></p>
<p id="L93">Incidentally, this firewood was chopped into firewood size pieces that we had cut for tax purposes in the village some time ago.<br><sup>ちなみにこの薪は、しばらく前に村で租税用にと切っておいたものを、薪のサイズに切り分けたものだ。</sup><br><sup>This wood, by the way, was cut for tax in the village some time ago and cut into the size of the wood.</sup></p>
<p id="L94">After all, since the wood has not been paid to the Istair family as a tax since then, the large amount of wood that was cut is being used in the village little by little.<br><sup>結局あれから木材は租税としてイステール家に納めていないため、切り出した大量の木材は村で少しずつ使われている。</sup><br><sup>As a result, the wood was not paid to the Istair family as a tax, so the large amount of wood cut out was gradually used in the village.</sup></p>
<p id="L95"><br></p>
<p id="L96">"......"<br><sup>「……ん」</sup><br><sup>"... well,"</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">Baretta, who had been paddling her boat until then, suddenly woke up.<br><sup>それまで舟をこいでいたバレッタは、ふと目を醒ました。</sup><br><sup>Valletta, who had been rowing until then, awoke.</sup></p>
<p id="L99">I felt a gaze behind me, and as I stretched, I turned my gaze vaguely in that direction.<br><sup>背後に視線を感じ、背伸びをしながらぼんやりとそちらに視線を向ける。</sup><br><sup>He felt his gaze behind him, stretched out and looked at him vaguely.</sup></p>
<p id="L100">In the dark bushes, there was a wolf-like beast the size of a cow staring at him.<br><sup>暗がりの藪の中、そこには牛ほどの大きさの狼のような獣が自分を見つめていた。</sup><br><sup>In the dark bushes there was a wolf-like beast the size of a cow staring at him.</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">"Oh, it's Uriboh."<br><sup>「（あ、ウリボゥだ）」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, it's Uribo,"</sup></p>
<p id="L103"><br></p>
<p id="L104">Baretta's eyes met with the beast that was staring straight at her - Uribow - and she thought in a daze.<br><sup>自分を真っ直ぐ見つめてくる獣――ウリボゥ――と目が合い、バレッタはぼんやりとした頭で考えた。</sup><br><sup>Her eyes met with the beast -- Uribo -- who looked straight at her, and Valletta thought vaguely.</sup></p>
<p id="L105">Then, for a few seconds, I finally understood what I was up against and felt a general hair-raising sensation all over my body.<br><sup>そして数秒、ようやく自分が何と対峙しているのかを理解し、全身が総毛立つような感覚に襲われた。</sup><br><sup>Then, for a few seconds, I finally understood what I was confronting, and I felt like I was hairy all over my body.</sup></p>
<p id="L106">The Uribow in front of her gaze was the most enormous thing Baretta had ever seen in her life.<br><sup>視線の先にいるウリボゥは、今までにバレッタが見たこともないほどに巨大だった。</sup><br><sup>The Uribo in front of me was so huge that Valletta had never seen it before.</sup></p>
<p id="L107">Roslou once showed me a carcass of an Uribow that he had killed in the mountains, and it was definitely two sizes larger than that.<br><sup>昔、ロズルーが山で仕留めたウリボゥの死骸を見せてくれたことがあるが、それよりも確実に２回り以上は大きい。</sup><br><sup>In the past, Rosloo showed us the body of a Uribo killed in the mountains, but it is more than twice as large as that.</sup></p>
<p id="L108"><br></p>
<p id="L109">I had heard that a fire would keep the Uribos away, but the fire at the entrance of the charcoal kiln didn't seem to have any effect.<br><sup>火を焚いていればウリボゥは近寄ってこないと聞いていたのだが、炭窯の入り口で焚かれている程度の大きさの火では効果がなかったようだ。</sup><br><sup>I heard that if the fire was on, the uribo wouldn't come close, but the fire at the entrance of the charcoal kiln would not have worked.</sup></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111">Baretta hurriedly stood up and clutched the hilt of the dagger she had inserted in her waist.<br><sup>バレッタは慌てて立ち上がり、腰に挿していた短剣の柄を握り締めた。</sup><br><sup>Valletta stood up in a hurry and clasped the handle of the dagger she had put in her waist.</sup></p>
<p id="L112">While grasping the handle, I watched Uriboh's movements.<br><sup>柄を握りながら、ウリボゥの動きを注視する。</sup><br><sup>Hold on to the handle and watch the movements of the bow.</sup></p>
