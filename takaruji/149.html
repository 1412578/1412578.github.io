<p id="L1">A few days later, late at night.<br><sup>数日後の深夜。</sup><br><sup>A few days later, late at night.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">Kazuyoshi was alone in his room, working on his craft.<br><sup>一良は自室で一人、工作作業に勤しんでいた。</sup><br><sup>Ichira was working alone in his room.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">A thin board with the center part soaked in water is burned in the fireplace and slowly bent.<br><sup>中央部分を水に漬けた薄い板を暖炉であぶり、じわじわと曲げる。</sup><br><sup>Bake a thin board soaked in water in the hearth and bend it slowly.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">Overlap the board with the other board that you bent earlier and center it.<br><sup>先に曲げておいたもう１枚の板と重ね合わせ、中心を出す。</sup><br><sup>Put it on top of the other board that has been bent before and center it.</sup></p>
<p id="L5"><br></p>
<p id="L6">"Mmm, you're a little off. I guess it's hard to bend them the same way. ......"<br><sup>「むう、少しずれてるな。同じように曲げるのって難しいんだな……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, it's a little off.It's hard to bend it the same way..."</sup></p>
<p id="L7"><br></p>
<p id="L8">Muttering to myself, I turn my attention to the screen of my laptop.<br><sup>ぶつぶつと独り言を漏らしながら、ノートパソコンの画面に目を向ける。</sup><br><sup>He muttered to himself and looked at the screen of his laptop screen.</sup></p>
<p id="L9">On it was a drawing of a crossbow that he had drawn up while referring to the book he had brought with him.<br><sup>そこには、持ってきた書籍を参考にしながら描き上げたクロスボウの図面が表示されていた。</sup><br><sup>There was a crossbow drawing drawn with reference to the book I brought.</sup></p>

<p id="L11">"......"<br><sup>「……」</sup><br><sup>「……」</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">He clicked the mouse and opened another document.<br><sup>マウスをカチカチと操作し、別の資料を開いた。</sup><br><sup>Click the mouse to open other materials.</sup></p>
<p id="L14">On the edge of the document projected on the screen, it read, "Grisea Village Conscription List.<br><sup>画面に映し出された資料の端には、『グリセア村徴兵名簿』と記載されている。</sup><br><sup>At the end of the data displayed on the screen is the "Glyceria Village Recruitment List."</sup></p>
<p id="L15">The names and ages of dozens of people were listed, and about half of the names had a line drawn through them indicating that they had died in battle (including death from disease).<br><sup>数十人の名前と年齢が羅列されており、その中の半数ほどの名前には戦死（病死含む）を示す線が引かれていた。</sup><br><sup>Dozens of people's names and ages were listed, and about half of them were marked with lines indicating death in battle (including death from illness).</sup></p>

<p id="L17">That was the name of Baretta's mother.<br><sup>バレッタの母親の名前だ。</sup><br><sup>It's Valletta's mother's name.</sup></p>
<p id="L18">Kazuyoshi took a breath and turned his attention back to the crossbow he had been working on.<br><sup>一良は息をつくと、気を取り直して作りかけのクロスボウに目を戻した。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira breathed his breath, he regained consciousness and looked back at the crossbow he had just made.</sup></p>
<p id="L19"><br></p>
<p id="L20">"It's a lot of work to make. ...... Good."<br><sup>「意外と作るのに手間がかかるなぁ。……よし」</sup><br><sup>"It takes more time than I expected to make it."... all right."</sup></p>
<p id="L21"><br></p>
<p id="L22">I managed to put the parts together and completed the first crossbow prototype.<br><sup>パーツを何とか組み合わせ、クロスボウ試作１号機が完成した。</sup><br><sup>The first Crossbow prototype was completed by somehow combining the parts.</sup></p>
<p id="L23">The bow is made of two thin boards joined together with glue made from a mixture of wax and sap.<br><sup>弓部分は、薄い板を２枚重ねにして蝋と樹液を混ぜて作った接着剤で接合したものだ。</sup><br><sup>The bow is made of two thin plates overlapping with adhesive made of wax and sap.</sup></p>
<p id="L24">The boards had to be roasted over a fire one by one and bent in exactly the same way, which was quite a difficult task for Kazuyoshi, an amateur craftsman.<br><sup>板は１枚ずつ火で炙って全く同じように曲げ加工しなければいけないため、工作素人の一良にとってはかなり難しい作業だった。</sup><br><sup>It was a very difficult task for Ichira, a master craftsman, because the boards had to be roasted one by one and bent in exactly the same way.</sup></p>
<p id="L25">The handle is made of wood that has been shaved to make it easier to hold, and the trigger is attached at the back.<br><sup>持ち手の部分は木材を削って持ちやすくしたもので、後方に引き金が付いている。</sup><br><sup>The handle is made easy to hold by cutting wood and has a trigger at the back.</sup></p>
<p id="L26">Nails were used to join the bow part to the handle part.<br><sup>弓部分と持ち手部分の接合には釘を用いた。</sup><br><sup>Nails are used to join the bow and handle parts.</sup></p>
<p id="L27"><br></p>
<p id="L28">"Okay, let's give it a shot. Will it fly?"<br><sup>「よし、試し撃ちしてみるか。ちゃんと飛ぶだろうか」</sup><br><sup>"Well, let's give it a shot.Will it fly properly?"</sup></p>
<p id="L29"><br></p>
<p id="L30">He took the wooden arrow he had prepared and grabbed the bowstring.<br><sup>用意しておいた木製の矢を持ち、弓の弦を掴んだ。</sup><br><sup>He took the prepared wooden arrow and grabbed the bowstring.</sup></p>
<p id="L31">Pull it up with force and set it on the trigger clasp.<br><sup>力を込めて引っ張り上げ、引き金の留め具にセットする。</sup><br><sup>Pull it up with force and set it on the trigger fastener.</sup></p>
<p id="L32">He placed a board with a circle in the center near the wall, took aim from a few meters away, and pulled the trigger.<br><sup>中心に丸が書かれた板を壁際に置き、数メートル離れたところから狙いを定めて引き金を引いた。</sup><br><sup>Place a board with a circle in the center near the wall and aim a few meters away and pull the trigger.</sup></p>
<p id="L33">The arrow shot out with great force and pierced the edge of the board with a dull thud.<br><sup>勢いよく矢が射出され、鈍い音とともに板の端に突き刺さった。</sup><br><sup>The arrow shot vigorously and pierced the edge of the board with a dull sound.</sup></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35">"Hey, that's really off the center of the target. ...... I wonder if the axis is off."<br><sup>「あれ、思いっきり的の中心から外れてるな……軸がずれてるのかな」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, you're as far from the center as you can... off the axis."</sup></p>
<p id="L36"><br></p>
<p id="L37">He crouched there, mumbling to himself and kneading his homemade crossbow.<br><sup>その場にしゃがみ込み、ぶつぶつと独り言を言いながらお手製クロスボウをこねくり回す。</sup><br><sup>He squatted down on the spot, muttered to himself, and kneaded his own crossbow.</sup></p>
<p id="L38">After doing so for a while, Kazuyoshi suddenly felt a presence behind him and turned around.<br><sup>しばらくそうしていた時、ふと背後に気配を感じて、一良は振り返った。</sup><br><sup>After doing so for a while, Kazura suddenly felt a sign behind him and looked back.</sup></p>
<p id="L39">A few centimeters in front of me, I saw Eira's face.<br><sup>目の前数センチの位置に、エイラの顔があった。</sup><br><sup>Ayla's face was a few centimeters in front of her.</sup></p>
<p id="L40"><br></p>
<p id="L41">"Oh, my God!"<br><sup>「おわあっ！？」</sup><br><sup>"What!"</sup></p>
<p id="L42"><br></p>
<p id="L43">"What?<br><sup>「ひゃあっ！？」</sup><br><sup>"What!"</sup></p>
<p id="L44"><br></p>
<p id="L45">Eira was startled by Ichirō's loud voice and jerked back.<br><sup>一良の上げた大声に驚き、エイラがのけぞる。</sup><br><sup>Surprised by Ichira's loud voice, Ayla backs away.</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">"I thought my heart would stop. I thought my heart was going to stop."<br><sup>「エ、エイラさん、いつの間にそこにいたんですか。心臓が止まるかと思いましたよ」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, Ayla, how long have you been there?I thought my heart was going to stop."</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">"Also, I'm sorry. I knocked on the door, but there was no answer. ...... I also called out to you when you entered the room, but you didn't notice. ......"<br><sup>「も、申し訳ございません。扉をノックしたのですが、ご返事がなかったので……入室した際もお声がけはしたのですが、お気づきになられなかったので……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I'm sorry.I knocked on the door, but there was no reply... I told you when I entered the room, but you didn't notice..."</sup></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51">"Really? Sorry, I guess I was concentrating too hard and didn't notice you at all. ...... So, what can I do for you?"<br><sup>「マジですか。すみません、集中しすぎてたみたいで全然気づきませんでした……で、何か用ですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Really? I'm sorry, I didn't notice at all because I seemed to have concentrated too much... so what do you want?"</sup></p>
<p id="L52"><br></p>
<p id="L53">"Oh, um, ...... you didn't come to the kitchen, so I was wondering what's going on. ......<br><sup>「あ、えっと……調理場にお越しにならないので、どうしたのかな、って……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, well... I wonder what's wrong with you not coming to the kitchen..."</sup></p>
<p id="L54"><br></p>
<p id="L55">Eira says, a little embarrassed.<br><sup>少し気恥ずかしそうに、エイラが言う。</sup><br><sup>said Ayla, a little embarrassed.</sup></p>
<p id="L56">Kazuyoshi looked at the clock on the side of the bed.<br><sup>一良はベッド脇に置いてある時計に目を向た。</sup><br><sup>Ichira looked at the clock beside the bed.</sup></p>
<p id="L57">The needle was about to point to 1:00 am.<br><sup>針は、間もなく深夜１時を指そうとしている。</sup><br><sup>The needle is about to point to one o'clock in the morning.</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">"Wow, I didn't realize it was already this late. I'm sorry, I kept you waiting."<br><sup>「うわ、もうこんな時間だったのか。すみません、待たせちゃいましたね」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, it's already this late.I'm sorry to have kept you waiting."</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">"Oh, no, I was just waiting on my own. Do you still have work to do, Lady Kazura?"<br><sup>「あ、いえ、私が勝手に待っていただけですから。カズラ様は、まだお仕事をされるのですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, no, I was just waiting for you.Mr. Kazura, are you still working?"</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63">"Hmm, yes. I think I'll do a few more. Oh, but I'd like to have some tea, too. ......"<br><sup>「んー、そうですね。あと少しだけやろうかな。あ、でも、お茶もしたいな……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's right.I think I'll do it a little more.Oh, but I'd like to have tea, too..."</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">"Then let's have tea here. I've brought you some sweets, if you'd like."<br><sup>「では、ここでお茶にいたしましょう。お菓子も持ってきてあるので、よろしければ召し上がってください」</sup><br><sup>"I'll have tea here, then.I also brought some sweets, so if you don't mind, please eat them."</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">With that, Eira picked up the copper pitcher on the table.<br><sup>そう言って、エイラはテーブル上の銅のピッチャーを手に取った。</sup><br><sup>Ayla picked up the copper pitcher on the table.</sup></p>
<p id="L68">Apparently, he had brought hot water from the kitchen.<br><sup>どうやら、調理場からお湯を持ってきていたようだ。</sup><br><sup>Apparently, they brought hot water from the kitchen.</sup></p>
<p id="L69">I poured hot water into a ceramic teapot and placed a plate of sweets on the table while waiting for the tea leaves to boil.<br><sup>陶器のティーポットにお湯を注ぎ、茶葉が煮だされるのを待つ間に菓子の乗った皿をテーブルに並べた。</sup><br><sup>I poured hot water into the pottery teapot and laid out a plate of sweets on the table while waiting for the tea leaves to boil.</sup></p>
<p id="L70">Today's pastry was a galette, a pastry made by mixing flour with a lot of butter and baking it.<br><sup>今日の茶菓子はガレット（小麦粉にバターをたっぷり混ぜて焼き上げたお菓子）だ。</sup><br><sup>Today's refreshments are garrettes.</sup></p>
<p id="L71"><br></p>
<p id="L72">"Oh, a galette.<br><sup>「お、ガレットですか」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, Garrett?"</sup></p>
<p id="L73"><br></p>
<p id="L74">"Yes, the one in the book you showed me last night looked very good, so I made it right away.<br><sup>「はい、昨晩見せていただいた本のものがとても美味しそうだったので、さっそく作ってみました」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, the book you showed me last night looked very delicious, so I made it right away."</sup></p>
<p id="L75"><br></p>
<p id="L76">Since the day a few months ago when they had their first late night tea party, the two of them had never missed a single night except for the days when Kazuyoshi was out.<br><sup>初めて深夜のお茶会をした数カ月前の日から、一良が外出している日を除けば、２人は一晩も欠かすことなくお茶会を行っていた。</sup><br><sup>From a few months before the first late-night tea party, the two of them held tea parties every night except on the day when Ichira was out.</sup></p>
<p id="L77">It wasn't that they had agreed to do so, but as they took care of each other and showed up at the kitchen, it had become the norm.<br><sup>別段２人で示し合わせているというわけではないのだが、お互いが気を使い合って調理場に顔を出しているうちに、いつしかそれが当たり前になってしまったのだ。</sup><br><sup>We didn't make any arrangements, but as we were looking out for each other in the kitchen, it became a matter of course.</sup></p>
<p id="L78">Last night, Kazuyoshi brought a recipe book for sweets, and we spent almost an hour reading it together and talking.<br><sup>昨晩は一良がお菓子のレシピ本を持ってきて、それを２人で読みながら１時間近くだべっていた。</sup><br><sup>Last night, Ichira brought a recipe book for sweets, and we spent almost an hour reading it together.</sup></p>
<p id="L79"><br></p>
<p id="L80">"This looks delicious. Did you make the butter, Eira?"<br><sup>「これは美味しそうですね。バターはエイラさんが作ったんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"This looks delicious.Did Mr. Ayla make it, Mr.make the butter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">"No, I asked Marie to make it for me. But as I was making it, people started to gather. ......"<br><sup>「いえ、マリーちゃんにお願いして作ってもらいました。でも、作ってるうちに人が集まってきちゃって……」</sup><br><sup>"No, I asked Marie to make it for me.But while I was making it, people gathered..."</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">Eira had asked Marie to make a large batch of butter from Myagi's milk during her lunch break today.<br><sup>エイラは今日の昼休み中にマリーに頼んで、ミャギのミルクからバターを大量に作ってもらっていた。</sup><br><sup>During lunch break today, Ayla asked Marie to make a large amount of butter out of myagi's milk.</sup></p>
<p id="L85">The process of making butter is quite simple: when you boil down raw milk, you collect the creamy substance that floats to the surface, put it in an airtight container, and shake it repeatedly.<br><sup>バターの作り方は至極単純で、生乳を煮詰めると浮いてくるクリーム状のものを集め、それを密閉された容器に入れてぶんぶんと何度も振るのだ。</sup><br><sup>The method of making butter is very simple: collect the creamy things that float when raw milk is boiled down, put them in a sealed container and shake them over and over again.</sup></p>
<p id="L86">When the butter is chilled for a few hours, it is ready to use.<br><sup>そうすると、べちゃっとした半固形状のものと水分とに分かれるので、半固形状のものを取り出して塩を混ぜ、数時間冷やせばバターの完成である。</sup><br><sup>Then, it is divided into sticky semi-solids and moisture, so the butter is finished by taking out the semi-solids, mixing them with salt, and cooling them for a few hours.</sup></p>
<p id="L87">Incidentally, this was not the first time I had made butter; I had made it a few months ago in the kitchen with Kazura, Eira, Marie, and several maids.<br><sup>ちなみに、バター作りは今回が初めてではなく、数か月前に調理場で一良とエイラとマリー、そして複数の侍女たちを交えて作ったことがあった。</sup><br><sup>By the way, this is not the first time I've made butter, but a few months ago in the kitchen with Ichira, Ayla, Marie, and several court ladies.</sup></p>
<p id="L88">Marie was still in charge of shaking the container.<br><sup>その時も容器を振る係はマリーだった。</sup><br><sup>Even then, Mary was the one who shook the container.</sup></p>
<p id="L89"><br></p>
<p id="L90">"When I told them I was making butter again, they wanted to use it too. Marie-chan made it for a while, but after the lunch break, the guards who were observing decided to do it. ...... "I was amazed at how Marie-chan was able to do such hard work! I was amazed.<br><sup>「またバターを作ってるって言ったら、皆が自分も使いたいって言いだしたんです。しばらくはマリーちゃんが作ってくれてたんですけど、お昼休みが終わった後は見学していた警備兵さんがやることになって……『こんな大変な作業、マリーちゃんよく出来たな！？』って驚いてました」</sup><br><sup>"When I said I was making butter again, everyone said they wanted to use it.Marie made it for a while, but after lunch break, the security guard who was looking at it decided to do it... I was surprised to hear, 'Marie did such a hard job well!'"</sup></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">Shaking the container to make butter is a lot of hard work.<br><sup>バターを作るために容器を振る作業は、かなりの重労働である。</sup><br><sup>Shaking containers to make butter is quite hard work.</sup></p>
<p id="L93">Unless you are a person with enhanced physical abilities like Marie, it would be a daunting task to keep making them continuously.<br><sup>マリーのように身体能力が強化された人間でなければ、連続して作り続けるのは大変な作業だろう。</sup><br><sup>If you're not as physically strong as Marie, it's hard to keep making it.</sup></p>
<p id="L94"><br></p>
<p id="L95">"I'm sure you'll be able to find something that works for you.　You have an early morning tomorrow. ......"<br><sup>「ああ、あれはきついですからね……あの、さっきはお茶したいなんて言いましたけど、時間大丈夫ですか？　明日も朝早いんじゃ……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that's hard... you said you wanted to have tea earlier, but is the time okay?Tomorrow is early in the morning too, isn't it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L96"><br></p>
<p id="L97">"I'm off tomorrow. I don't have any plans, and I don't mind staying up late."<br><sup>「私、明日はお休みなんです。特に予定もありませんし、夜更かししても大丈夫です」</sup><br><sup>"Tomorrow is my day off.I don't have any particular plans, and I don't mind staying up late."</sup></p>
<p id="L98"><br></p>
<p id="L99">"Oh, I see. It's nice to have a day off.<br><sup>「あ、そうなんですか。お休みなのか、いいなあ」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, is that so?I hope you're on vacation."</sup></p>
<p id="L100"><br></p>
<p id="L101">"Perhaps you should take a break once in a while, Miss Kazura.<br><sup>「カズラ様も、たまにはお休みを取られたほうがよろしいのでは」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Kazura, I think you should take a day off once in a while,"</sup></p>
<p id="L102"><br></p>
<p id="L103">"Hmmm, Narson and the others never take a day off, so I don't feel comfortable being the only one.<br><sup>「うーん、ナルソンさんたちが全然休まないんで、自分だけっていうのも気が引けるんですよね」</sup><br><sup>"Well, they don't rest at all, so I don't feel like being the only one."</sup></p>
<p id="L104"><br></p>
<p id="L105">Eira looked worried when Ichiran said that.<br><sup>一良が言うと、エイラは心配そうな顔になった。</sup><br><sup>As Ichira said, Ayla looked worried.</sup></p>
<p id="L106"><br></p>
<p id="L107">"Please don't take it too hard. If you can't take a whole day, it would be better to take a half day to relax and get away from work.<br><sup>「あまりご無理はされないでください。一日が無理なら半日だけでも、お仕事から離れてゆっくりする時間を取られたほうがいいですよ」</sup><br><sup>"Don't push yourself too hard.If you can't make a day of it, you'd better take half a day off work and relax."</sup></p>
<p id="L108"><br></p>
<p id="L109">"Well, ......, maybe next time I'll suggest that we invite everyone to take a day off. It's not like we're going out together or anything, we're just going to hang out freely."<br><sup>「そうですねぇ……今度、皆を誘って一日休みにすることを提案してみますか。皆でどこか出かけるとかじゃなくて、自由にダラダラ過ごすってことで」</sup><br><sup>"Well...Would you like to invite everyone to take a day off next time?It's not that we're all going out somewhere, it's that we're going to hang out freely."</sup></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111">"That's better. Also, Lady Baretta seems to be severely tired these days, so I think you should suggest a good night's rest as soon as possible."<br><sup>「それがいいですよ。あと、バレッタ様はここ最近酷く疲れているように見えるので、早めにお休みの提案をしたほうがいいと思います」</sup><br><sup>"That's all right.Also, Mr. Valletta seems very tired these days, so I think you should make a suggestion to take a day off early."</sup></p>
<p id="L112"><br></p>
<p id="L113">"What, Baretta?"<br><sup>「え、バレッタさんが？」</sup><br><sup>"What, Mr. Valletta?"</sup></p>
<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115">When Kazuyoshi asked back in surprise, Eira laughed and said, "I knew it.<br><sup>驚いた様子で聞き返す一良に、エイラは「やっぱり」と苦笑した。</sup><br><sup>Ayla smiled bitterly at Ichira, who looked surprised and asked back.</sup></p>
<p id="L116"><br></p>
<p id="L117">"Yes. For the past few days, I've noticed that you seem to be in a daze or sighing a lot. When I talk to her, all she says is "I'm fine," so I'm worried."<br><sup>「はい。ここ数日、ぼうっとしていたりため息をついていたりすることが多いように感じます。声をかけても「大丈夫」としかおっしゃらないので、心配で」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I feel like I've been dazed and sighing a lot these past few days.I'm worried because even if I talk to you, you only say "it's okay."</sup></p>
<p id="L118"><br></p>
<p id="L119">"Really? ...... Ummm, I didn't notice that at all."<br><sup>「マジですか……ううむ、全然気づかなかったな」</sup><br><sup>"Really... well, I didn't notice at all."</sup></p>
<p id="L120"><br></p>
<p id="L121">"I don't blame him, he seemed to be trying his best to act cheerful in front of Kazura-sama. I'm sure he doesn't want you to worry."<br><sup>「カズラ様の前では努めて元気に振舞っている様子でしたから、仕方ないですよ。きっと、心配をかけたくないのだと思います」</sup><br><sup>"It can't be helped because he seemed to be doing well in front of Kazura.I'm sure they don't want to worry."</sup></p>
<p id="L122"><br></p>
<p id="L123">"I didn't know that. I'm glad you told me. She seems to work endlessly, no matter how tired she is. I have to be careful.<br><sup>「そうだったんですね。教えてくれて助かりました。彼女、いくら疲れてても際限なく頑張っちゃうみたいなんですよね。気を付けないと」</sup><br><sup>"I see.It was helpful that you told me.No matter how tired she is, she seems to work hard indefinitely.You have to be careful."</sup></p>
<p id="L124"><br></p>
<p id="L125">After that, the two of them stayed up until past two in the morning talking.<br><sup>その後、何だかんだで朝の２時過ぎまで、２人はだべっていた。</sup><br><sup>After that, somehow until after two o'clock in the morning, the two of them were hanging out.</sup></p>
<p id="L126">It was time to go to bed, so Eira cleaned up the dishes and left the table.<br><sup>さすがにそろそろ寝なければ、ということで、食器を片付けてエイラが席を立つ。</sup><br><sup>As expected, I had to go to bed soon, so Ayla cleared the dishes and left her seat.</sup></p>
<p id="L127"><br></p>
<p id="L128">"I apologize for disturbing you so late.<br><sup>「遅くまでお邪魔してしまい、申し訳ございませんでした」</sup><br><sup>"I'm sorry to have kept you up so late."</sup></p>

<p id="L130">"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. The sweets were really good.<br><sup>「いえいえ、こっちこそお茶に付き合ってもらったうえに片付けまでお願いしちゃってすみません。お菓子、すごく美味しかったですよ」</sup><br><sup>"No, no, I'm sorry I asked you to go out with me for tea and clean up.The sweets were very delicious."</sup></p>

<p id="L133"><br></p>
<p id="L134">Eira smiled at that and turned her attention to the crossbow propped up on the wall.<br><sup>エイラはそう言って微笑むと、壁に立てかけてあるクロスボウへと目を向けた。</sup><br><sup>Ayla smiled and looked at the crossbow against the wall.</sup></p>
<p id="L135"><br></p>
<p id="L136">"Please take it easy on yourself, Mr. Kazura. If there's anything I can do to help, please let me know.

<p id="L139"><br></p>
<p id="L140">"It's okay. Don't worry, I won't talk to Baretta-sama or anyone else, of course. Now, if you'll excuse me.<br><sup>「大丈夫です。バレッタ様や、もちろん他のかたにも話したりはしませんので、ご安心ください。では、失礼いたします」</sup><br><sup>"Don't worry, I won't tell Valletta or anyone else, of course.Well, excuse me."</sup></p>
<p id="L141"><br></p>
<p id="L142">With that, he bowed and quietly left the room.<br><sup>そう言ってぺこりと一礼すると、静かに部屋を出て行った。</sup><br><sup>He bowed and left the room quietly.</sup></p>
<p id="L143"><br></p>
<p id="L144">"...... Hmm, I can't compete with that guy. I really can't get over him."<br><sup>「……うーん、あの人には敵わないな。ほんと、頭が上がらない」</sup><br><sup>"... well, I'm no match for him.I really can't stand it."</sup></p>
<p id="L145"><br></p>
<p id="L146">He scratched his head and picked up his crossbow again.<br><sup>ぽりぽりと頭を掻き、再びクロスボウを手に取った。</sup><br><sup>He scratched his head and picked up the crossbow again.</sup></p>
<p id="L147"><br></p>

<p id="L149"><br></p>
<p id="L150">A few afternoons later.<br><sup>それから数日後の午後。</sup><br><sup>A few days later, in the afternoon.</sup></p>
<p id="L151">Baretta was running at a short pace through the upscale commercial district where light snowflakes were flying.<br><sup>小雪の舞う高級商業区画を、バレッタは小走りで駆けていた。</sup><br><sup>Valletta was trotting through the high-end commercial district where light snow was flying.</sup></p>
<p id="L152">He was wearing a thick coat and had a large wooden basket hanging from his hand.<br><sup>厚手のコートを着込み、手には大きな木のカゴをぶらさげている。</sup><br><sup>He wore a thick coat and hung a large wooden basket in his hand.</sup></p>
<p id="L153">In the basket is one large sack of the best quality bread wheat flour from the Fry's territory.<br><sup>カゴの中には、フライス領産の最高品質のパン麦粉の大袋が１つ。</sup><br><sup>In the basket is a large bag of the highest quality bread flour produced in milling.</sup></p>
<p id="L154">In addition, there were dried fruits and nuts that I had scoured the stores to buy.<br><sup>その他に、あちこちの店を探し回って買い集めたドライフルーツや木の実が入っている。</sup><br><sup>In addition, dried fruits and nuts from various shops are also included.</sup></p>
<p id="L155"><br></p>
<p id="L156">"I think I'll make some butter and cottage cheese later tonight. Fruit vinegar, I believe I have some in the kitchen."<br><sup>「今夜のうちにバターとカッテージチーズ（温めた生乳に酢を混ぜるだけで作ることができるチーズ）も作ろうかな。果実酢、確か調理場にあったよね」</sup><br><sup>"I think I'll make butter and cottage cheese tonight.I think the fruit vinegar was in the kitchen."</sup></p>
<p id="L157"><br></p>
<p id="L158">Valletta looked elated and hurried to the next store.<br><sup>バレッタはうきうきとした様子で、次の店へと急ぐ。</sup><br><sup>Valletta looks excited and hurried to the next store.</sup></p>
<p id="L159">Tomorrow, I have the whole day off.<br><sup>明日は、丸１日休みである。</sup><br><sup>I have a whole day off tomorrow.</sup></p>
<p id="L160">A few days ago, Kazuyoshi suddenly suggested that we all take a day off, and after much debate (only Narson was reluctant until the very end), it was decided that we would all take a day off.<br><sup>何日か前に突然一良が「皆で休みを取ろう」と言い出して、賛否両論（ナルソンだけが最後まで渋っていた）が出た末に、全員が１日休暇を取ることが決定した。</sup><br><sup>A few days ago, Ichira suddenly said, "Let's take a day off together," and after controversy over the pros and cons (Nalson was the only one who was reluctant to take a day off), it was decided that everyone would take a day off.</sup></p>
<p id="L161">Marie, Havel, Isaac, and Eira were also taking the day off, and they seemed to be spending it as they pleased.<br><sup>マリーやハベル、アイザックとエイラも休みを取ることになり、各々好きに過ごすようだ。</sup><br><sup>Marie, Hubbard, Isaac and Ayla will also take a day off, and they will spend their time as they please.</sup></p>
<p id="L162">After thinking about what she would do on this sudden holiday, Baretta decided to spend the whole day cooking.<br><sup>突然降って湧いた休日に、バレッタはどうしようかと考えた末、１日中料理をして過ごすことに決めた。</sup><br><sup>After thinking about what to do with Valletta on a sudden rainy holiday, she decided to spend the whole day cooking.</sup></p>
<p id="L163">She usually cooks meals for Ichiran, but since she is also working at the same time and Marie works with her in a short time, she is not able to cook very elaborate dishes.<br><sup>普段から一良のために食事を作ってはいるが、仕事も兼任しているうえにマリーも一緒に短時間で作業を行うため、あまり凝った料理を作ることができずにいた。</sup><br><sup>I usually cook for Ichira, but I couldn't cook very elaborate food because I was also working at the same time and Mary worked with her in a short time.</sup></p>
<p id="L164">So I planned to use the day tomorrow to try different dishes and expand my repertoire.<br><sup>なので、明日１日を使っていろいろな料理に挑戦し、レパートリーを広げようと計画したのである。</sup><br><sup>So I planned to use tomorrow's day to try various dishes and expand my repertoire.</sup></p>
<p id="L165">By the way, what I'm trying to make with the ingredients I have now is a cheesecake using cottage cheese.<br><sup>ちなみに、今持っている材料で作ろうとしているのは、カッテージチーズを使ったチーズケーキだ。</sup><br><sup>By the way, what I'm trying to make out of the ingredients I have now is a cheesecake with cottage cheese.</sup></p>
<p id="L166"><br></p>
<p id="L167">"Hey!<br><sup>「やあ！」</sup><br><sup>"Hello!"</sup></p>
<p id="L168"><br></p>
<p id="L169">"Whoa!<br><sup>「うひゃあ！？」</sup><br><sup>"Whoa!"</sup></p>
<p id="L170"><br></p>
<p id="L171">As I was trotting along, I was suddenly grabbed from behind by both shoulders.<br><sup>トコトコと走っていると、急に背後から両肩を掴まれた。</sup><br><sup>While I was running, I was suddenly grabbed by the shoulders from behind.</sup></p>
<p id="L172">Surprised, I turned around to see a smiling Alondo there.<br><sup>驚いて振り返ると、そこには笑顔のアロンドがいた。</sup><br><sup>Surprised, I turned around and saw Alondo smiling.</sup></p>
<p id="L173"><br></p>
<p id="L174">"Oh, Mr. Arondo, ......."<br><sup>「ア、アロンド様……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, Mr. Alonde..."</sup></p>
<p id="L175"><br></p>
<p id="L176">"Oh no, you don't have to be so disgusting about this strange ...... place. It hurts my feelings."<br><sup>「いやあ、こんなところで奇遇だね……って、そんなに嫌な顔しなくてもいいじゃないか。傷付くなぁ」</sup><br><sup>"Well, you don't have to look so bad here, do you?Don't hurt me."</sup></p>
<p id="L177"><br></p>
<p id="L178">Arondo shrugged his shoulders and smiled at Baretta, whose expression was overtly clouded.<br><sup>あからさまに表情を曇らせたバレッタに、アロンドが肩をすくめて苦笑してみせる。</sup><br><sup>Alond shrugs and smiles bitterly at Valletta, whose expression is obviously clouded.</sup></p>
<p id="L179"><br></p>
<p id="L180">"Oh, no, not at all. ...... Um, how did you get here?<br><sup>「あ、いえ、そんなことは……あの、どうしてここに？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, no, that's not the case... you know, why are you here?"</sup></p>
<p id="L181"><br></p>
<p id="L182">"I just happened to see you when I was shopping, so I called out to you. It's just a coincidence, isn't it?<br><sup>「どうしても何も、たまたま買い物に寄ったらキミを見かけたから声をかけたんだよ。ほんと、偶然だよね」</sup><br><sup>"I just happened to see you when I stopped by for shopping, so I called out.It's a coincidence, isn't it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L183"><br></p>
<p id="L184">"Yeah, I know.<br><sup>「そ、そうですね」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, sir,"</sup></p>
<p id="L185"><br></p>
<p id="L186">"You're shopping, too?　Bread flour and dried fruit: ...... Oh, okay. You're going to make fruitcake or cookies, right?"<br><sup>「キミも買い物かい？　パン麦粉に干した果物……あ、分かった。フルーツケーキかクッキーを作るんだろ？」</sup><br><sup>"Are you shopping, too?Fruits dried in bread crumbs... Oh, I see.You're going to make fruit cakes or cookies, aren't you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L187"><br></p>
<p id="L188">"Yes. That's about it."<br><sup>「はい。そんなところです」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, that's about it."</sup></p>
<p id="L189"><br></p>
<p id="L190">Baretta replies, her expression slightly strained.<br><sup>若干表情を引きつらせながら、バレッタが答える。</sup><br><sup>replied Valletta, with a slight twitch in his face.</sup></p>
<p id="L191">Ever since he had turned down the offer of a job offer more than a dozen days ago, he had almost always run into Alondo when he went out to work or to buy groceries.<br><sup>十数日前に引き抜きの誘いを断ってからというもの、仕事や食材の買い出しで外出すると、ほぼ必ずアロンドと遭遇するのだ。</sup><br><sup>He almost always encounters Alondo when he goes out on business or food shopping since he turned down his invitation ten days ago.</sup></p>
<p id="L192">I was relieved not to see him today, but this is how I ended up getting caught.<br><sup>今日は会わずにほっとしていたのだが、結局こうして捕まってしまった。</sup><br><sup>I was relieved that I didn't see him today, but this is how I got caught.</sup></p>
<p id="L193"><br></p>
<p id="L194">"Are you going home to cook now?"<br><sup>「今から帰って作るのかい？」</sup><br><sup>"Are you going home now to make it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L195"><br></p>
<p id="L196">"No, I'll make it tomorrow. I thought I'd make it in time for snack."<br><sup>「いえ、作るのは明日です。おやつ時に合わせて作ろうかなと」</sup><br><sup>"No, I'll make it tomorrow.I think I'll make it according to the snack time."</sup></p>
<p id="L197"><br></p>
<p id="L198">"Oh, that's nice. I'm also going to the mansion tomorrow for some business, can I come over for a bite?"<br><sup>「お、いいねえ。俺も明日は用事があって屋敷に行くんだけど、食べにお邪魔してもいいかな？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that's good.I'm going to the mansion tomorrow on business, but may I come and eat?"</sup></p>
<p id="L199"><br></p>
<p id="L200">"Yes, yes."<br><sup>「は、はい」</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L201"><br></p>
<p id="L202">Unable to say no, Baretta nodded with a slightly drawn out smile on her face.<br><sup>断るわけにもいかず、やや引きつった笑みを浮かべてバレッタは頷く。</sup><br><sup>I couldn't say no, but Valletta nods with a slightly strained smile.</sup></p>
<p id="L203"><br></p>
<p id="L204">"Do you still need to buy anything?"<br><sup>「まだ何か買うものはあるの？」</sup><br><sup>"Is there anything else to buy?"</sup></p>
<p id="L205"><br></p>
<p id="L206">"Yes. About 20 Arcadian bugs."<br><sup>「はい。アルカディアン虫を20匹ほど」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, about 20 Arcadians."</sup></p>
<p id="L207"><br></p>
<p id="L208">"Arcadian bugs?　They're pretty hard to come by this time of year, aren't they?"<br><sup>「アルカディアン虫？　今の時期だと、かなり手に入りにくいんじゃないかな？」</sup><br><sup>"Arcadian worm? Isn't it quite hard to get at this time of year?"</sup></p>
<p id="L209"><br></p>
<p id="L210">"Yes, but I really wanted it. It's Kazura-san's favorite food (or so Baretta thinks)."<br><sup>「そうなんですが、どうしても欲しくて。カズラさんの大好物（だとバレッタは思っている）なので」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, but I really wanted it.It's Mr. Kazura's favorite food (that Valletta thinks so."</sup></p>
<p id="L211"><br></p>
<p id="L212">"Hmmm. ......"<br><sup>「ふーん……」</sup><br><sup>"Well..."</sup></p>
<p id="L213"><br></p>
<p id="L214">When Baretta dared to mention Kazura's name, Arondo gave a thin response.<br><sup>あえて一良の名前を出したバレッタに、アロンドは薄い反応を返す。</sup><br><sup>Arond dared to react lightly to Valletta, who dared to name Ichira.</sup></p>
<p id="L215">Since she has a business relationship with Arondo, she can't treat him badly, and since he is a very senior person in Baretta's eyes, she can't say anything strongly.<br><sup>アロンドとは仕事で繋がりがあるため邪険に扱うわけにもいかないうえに、バレッタから見ればかなり目上の人間なので強く言うこともできない。</sup><br><sup>I can't treat Alond harshly because I have a connection with him at work, and I can't say anything strongly because I'm quite senior to Valletta.</sup></p>
<p id="L216">So I've been trying to get him to give up somehow, citing Ichirō at every turn, but he doesn't seem to be giving up at all.<br><sup>なので、何とか諦めてもらおうと事あるごとに一良を引き合いに出しているのだが、彼は一向に諦める様子がない。</sup><br><sup>So he cites Ichira every time he tries to get her to give up, but he doesn't seem to give up at all.</sup></p>
<p id="L217">The only thing that has changed is that when I mention Kazuyoshi's name, he starts to look a little unhappy.<br><sup>しいて変わった点といえば、一良の名前を出すとやや不機嫌そうな様子が見られるようになってきたことくらいだ。</sup><br><sup>The only thing that has changed since then is that when I mention Ichira's name, he seems to be a little displeased.</sup></p>
<p id="L218"><br></p>
<p id="L219">"Well, I'll stay with you until you finish shopping. I know a store that has a good selection of edible insects, let's go there."<br><sup>「まあ、買い物が終わるまで付き合うよ。食用虫の品ぞろえがいい店を知ってるから、そこに行こうか」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I'll go out with you until I finish shopping.I know a restaurant with a good selection of edible insects, so let's go there."</sup></p>
<p id="L220"><br></p>
<p id="L221">"Yes, yes."<br><sup>「は、はい」</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L222"><br></p>
<p id="L223">Forced into the conversation, Baretta had no choice but to go along with Arondo.<br><sup>半ば強引に話を纏められ、バレッタは仕方なくアロンドに付いていくことにした。</sup><br><sup>Half-forcefully concluded, Valletta had no choice but to follow Alonde.</sup></p>
<p id="L224">Although he was no longer forcibly taken out from place to place as before, Arondo was still following Baretta around in this way.<br><sup>以前のように強引にあちこちに連れ出されることはなくなったものの、こうしてアロンドはバレッタに付きまとうようになっていた。</sup><br><sup>Alond was thus haunted by Valletta, though he was no longer forcibly led here and there as before.</sup></p>
<p id="L225">I even asked him if he didn't have to do his own work, but he said, "No problem.<br><sup>自分の仕事はしなくていいのかとそれとなく聞いたこともあるのだが、彼曰く「問題ない」とのことらしい。</sup><br><sup>I asked him casually if he didn't have to do his job, but he said, "There's no problem."</sup></p>
<p id="L226">Even though she had refused once, she was still being followed around like this, and Baretta was quite troubled.<br><sup>一度断っているにも関わらず、こうしてしつこく付きまとわれ、バレッタはかなり困っていた。</sup><br><sup>Even though he had refused once, he was so persistent that Valletta was in considerable trouble.</sup></p>
<p id="L227">They asked me about this and that, and I replied appropriately as I walked through the commercial area.<br><sup>あれやこれやと話題を振られ、適当に返事を返しながら商業区画を進む。</sup><br><sup>After being talked about in this and that, he returned an appropriate reply and proceeded through the commercial area.</sup></p>
<p id="L228">So we arrived at the restaurant we were looking for, and we both went inside.<br><sup>そうして目当ての店にたどり着き、２人して店内に入った。</sup><br><sup>Then we arrived at the shop we wanted and entered the shop together.</sup></p>
<p id="L229"><br></p>
<p id="L230">"Welcome to ......, Mr. Arondo!　Welcome aboard!"<br><sup>「いらっしゃいま……アロンド様！　ようこそいらっしゃいました！」</sup><br><sup>"Welcome... Mr. Alond! Welcome!"</sup></p>
<p id="L231"><br></p>
<p id="L232">The young woman clerk who was checking the products on the shelf bowed deeply when she saw Alondo.<br><sup>棚の商品をチェックしていた店員の若い女は、アロンドを見ると深々と礼をした。</sup><br><sup>The young clerk, who was checking the goods on the shelf, bowed deeply when she saw Alondo.</sup></p>
<p id="L233">As Arondo and I went out to the upscale commercial district, many of the people we met everywhere we went had the same reaction as this shopkeeper.<br><sup>アロンドと高級商業区画へと出かけると、行く先々で出会う人々の多くがこの店員と同じような反応を取る。</sup><br><sup>Many of the people I meet everywhere react the same way as this clerk when I go to Alondo and the high-end commercial district.</sup></p>
<p id="L234">It seems that Arondo is also quite open-minded, though not as open-minded as Liese.<br><sup>リーゼほどとまではいかないにしろ、アロンドもかなり顔が広いようだ。</sup><br><sup>Alondo, if not as wide as Liese, seems to have a pretty wide face.</sup></p>
<p id="L235"><br></p>
<p id="L236">"Hey, long time no see. I'm looking for an Arcadian worm, do you have one?"<br><sup>「やあ、久しぶり。アルカディアン虫を探してるんだけど、あるかな？」</sup><br><sup>"Long time no see.I'm looking for an Arcadian bug. Do you have it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L237"><br></p>
<p id="L238">"Arcadian worm, huh? I have a few pupae if you want them."<br><sup>「アルカディアン虫ですか。サナギでよろしければ少しありますよ」</sup><br><sup>"Arcadians?If you don't mind Sanagi, there are a few."</sup></p>
<p id="L239"><br></p>
<p id="L240">"He said. What do we do?"<br><sup>「だってさ。どうする？」</sup><br><sup>"Because, what shall we do?"</sup></p>
<p id="L241"><br></p>
<p id="L242">"Hmm, a pupa. ......<br><sup>「うーん、サナギですか……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, Sanagi?"</sup></p>
<p id="L243"><br></p>
<p id="L244">Arcadian worms become pupae during midwinter and hatch into adults in the spring.<br><sup>アルカディアン虫は真冬の間にサナギになり、春になると成虫へと羽化する。</sup><br><sup>Arcadians turn into sandpiper in the middle of winter and turn into adults in spring.</sup></p>
<p id="L245">The adult is about 15 centimeters in diameter, colored like a dead branch, and looks like a Nanafushi.<br><sup>成虫は直径15センチほどの枯れ枝のような色をした、ナナフシのような見た目だ。</sup><br><sup>Adults have the appearance of dead branches, about 15 centimeters in diameter, and they look like leaflets.</sup></p>
<p id="L246">The pupa can also be eaten, but it is not very tasty.<br><sup>サナギも食べることができるが、あまり美味しくはない。</sup><br><sup>Sanagi can also be eaten, but it is not very delicious.</sup></p>
<p id="L247">The adults are too hard to eat.<br><sup>成虫は硬すぎて食べることはできない。</sup><br><sup>Adults are too hard to eat.</sup></p>
<p id="L248"><br></p>
<p id="L249">"How about some adult crocodiles?　I think they're pretty tasty, fried in oil."<br><sup>「クロコ虫の成虫とかどうだい？　油で揚げたやつとか、そこそこ美味しいと思うけど」</sup><br><sup>"What do you think of adult crocodile insects?I think fried ones are rather delicious."</sup></p>
<p id="L250"><br></p>
<p id="L251">"No, I want to mix the larvae paste into the cake batter, so I want a mild, rich worm.<br><sup>「いえ、幼虫のペーストをケーキの生地に混ぜたいので、まろやかでコクがある虫がいいんです」</sup><br><sup>"No, I'd like a mild, rich insect because I want to mix larva paste with the cake dough."</sup></p>
<p id="L252"><br></p>
<p id="L253">"Then what about driftwood bugs?　You can get larvae of that any time of year."<br><sup>「それなら流木虫は？　あれならどの時期でも幼虫は採れるし」</sup><br><sup>"Then what about drifters?"You can catch larvae at any time of the year."</sup></p>
<p id="L254"><br></p>
<p id="L255">"It's rich, but it's a little bitter. ...... And it's got a little bit of a muddy flavor.<br><sup>「あれはコクはありますけど、苦みが少し強いので……それに、ちょっとだけ泥臭いような風味がありますし」</sup><br><sup>"It's rich, but it's a little bitter... and it smells a little muddy."</sup></p>
<p id="L256"><br></p>
<p id="L257">"I used to catch them when I was playing in the river with Havel. I used to catch them and eat them when Havel and I were playing in the river, but he didn't like them. I like it, though."<br><sup>「あー、確かに。俺も昔、ハベルと川遊びしてた時捕まえてよく食べたけど、ハベルは嫌な顔してたなぁ。俺は好きなんだけどね」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, indeed.I used to catch and eat a lot when I was playing in the river with Hubbell, but Hubbell looked displeased.I like it, though."</sup></p>
<p id="L258"><br></p>
<p id="L259">"It's delicious in its own way. When you bake it, the bitterness disappears, but the smell increases, so I don't think I can put it in a cake.<br><sup>「それなりに美味しいんですけどね。焼くと苦みは消えるけど余計に臭みが増しますし、ちょっとケーキには入れられないかなと」</sup><br><sup>"It's delicious in its own way.When baked, the bitterness disappears, but it smells even more, so I think I can put it in the cake."</sup></p>
<p id="L260"><br></p>
<p id="L261">"I see. So you can't cook it raw?<br><sup>「そっか、焼くから生でってわけにはいかないのか」</sup><br><sup>"Well, can't you cook it raw?"</sup></p>
<p id="L262"><br></p>
<p id="L263">"Yes, so I was wondering what to do."<br><sup>「はい、なのでどうしようかなって」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, so I was wondering what to do."</sup></p>
<p id="L264"><br></p>
<p id="L265">"Hmm. Well then. ......"<br><sup>「うーん。じゃあさ……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, then..."</sup></p>
<p id="L266"><br></p>
<p id="L267">While the two of them were discussing insects, Baretta noticed that the clerk was looking at her smiling.<br><sup>あれこれと２人で虫談議をしていると、店員が微笑ましそうに見ているのにバレッタは気が付いた。</sup><br><sup>As the two of us were arguing about insects, Valletta noticed that the clerk was smiling.</sup></p>
<p id="L268">Before I knew it, I realized that Alondo was snuggling up to me, and I hurriedly took a step away from him.<br><sup>いつのまにかアロンドに寄り添われていることに気づき、慌てて一歩距離をとる。</sup><br><sup>Before I knew it, I realized that Alond was cuddling up to me and hurriedly took a step away.</sup></p>
<p id="L269"><br></p>
<p id="L270">"Well, I guess I'll give up on bugs. Thank you very much.<br><sup>「え、えっと、やっぱり虫は諦めます。ありがとうございました」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I'll give up insects, after all.Thank you very much."</sup></p>
<p id="L271"><br></p>
<p id="L272">He then bowed to the waitress and hurriedly left the store.<br><sup>そう言ってぺこりと店員に頭を下げ、慌てて店を出るのだった。</sup><br><sup>He bowed to the clerk and hurried out of the store.</sup></p>
<p id="L273"><br></p>
<p id="L274"><br></p>
<p id="L275"><br></p>
<p id="L276">"Well, let's go find something to replace it. There's a fruit stand down the street that I like."<br><sup>「じゃあ、何か代わりのものを探しにいこうか。この先に、贔屓にしてる果物屋があるんだ」</sup><br><sup>"Well, let's go and find something to replace it.There's a fruit shop I like down the road."</sup></p>

<p id="L278">"Oh, well, I think I'll go home now. ......"<br><sup>「あ、あの、やっぱり今日はもう帰ろうかと……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, you know, I'm thinking about going home today..."</sup></p>
<p id="L279"><br></p>
<p id="L280">Valletta said, refusing Alondo's hand to hug her shoulder.<br><sup>肩を抱こうとしてくるアロンドの手を遠慮がちに拒みながら、バレッタが言う。</sup><br><sup>said Valletta, hesitatingly refusing Alondo's hand, who was about to hug his shoulder.</sup></p>
