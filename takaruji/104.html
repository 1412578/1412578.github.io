<p id="L1">The next morning.<br><sup>次の日の朝。</sup><br><sup>The next morning.</sup></p>
<p id="L2"><br></p>
<p id="L3">After they finished breakfast, they were in Kazuyoshi's room discussing a piece of paper in front of him.<br><sup>２人は朝食を済ませると、一良の部屋で１枚のメモ紙を前に話し合っていた。</sup><br><sup>After breakfast, they were discussing a note in Ichira's room.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">The note paper was a list of items that Valletta had written down last night that she wanted Ichiran to procure for her.<br><sup>メモ紙は、バレッタが昨晩のうちに書いておいた、一良に調達してきてほしい品物のリストだ。</sup><br><sup>Memo paper is a list of items Valletta wrote last night that she wanted Ichira to procure.</sup></p>
<p id="L5"><br></p>
<p id="L6">"Well, steel circular blades, fertilizer, nails, and ...... firebricks. Are you planning on making steel, by any chance?"<br><sup>「ええと、鋼鉄の円刃と肥料と釘と……お、耐火レンガですか。もしかして、鉄を作るつもりだったりします？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, steel circular blades, fertilizers and nails... oh, firebricks?"Are you ever going to make iron?"</sup></p>
<p id="L7"><br></p>
<p id="L8">Kazuyoshi looked up at the words "fire bricks" written on the wall.<br><sup>書かれている『耐火レンガ』という文字に目を留め、一良は顔を上げた。</sup><br><sup>Kazura looked up at the word "firebrick" written on it.</sup></p>
<p id="L9"><br></p>
<p id="L10">Yes. Kazura-san gave me a book that had a lot of information in it, so I thought I'd like to try making one.<br><sup>「はい。カズラさんに貰った本に色々と書いてあったので、作ってみたいなと思って」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, there were a lot of things written in the book Kazura gave me, so I wanted to make them."</sup></p>
<p id="L11"><br></p>
<p id="L12">I see, so that's how they made charcoal. But there's a forest nearby, so there's no need to burn charcoal in the mountains, is there?"<br><sup>「なるほど、それで炭を焼いていたんですか。でも、近くに森もあるし、わざわざ山で炭焼きをしなくてもよかったんじゃないですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's why you were burning charcoal.But there's a forest nearby, and you didn't have to go out of your way to grill charcoal in the mountains, did you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L13"><br></p>
<p id="L14">Well, to make a charcoal kiln, we need to use something called kamatsuchi, but we use soil from the mountains as the material. So, it was a hassle to carry the soil all the way to the village. ...... It doesn't take much time to run around, so we decided to do it all in the mountains.<br><sup>「えっと、炭窯を作るのにカマツチというものを使わないといけないんですけど、その材料となる土は山のものを使うんです。なので、わざわざ村まで土を運ぶのが面倒で……走って移動する分には大して時間がかからないので、山で全部やってしまうことにしたんです」</sup><br><sup>"Well, you have to use a kamatsuchi to make a charcoal kiln, but the soil used as the material is from the mountains.So it was troublesome to carry the soil all the way to the village... and it didn't take long to run and move, so I decided to do everything in the mountains."</sup></p>
<p id="L15"><br></p>
<p id="L16">Kamatsuchi is a fire-resistant mortar made by kneading soil with high silicate content into mortar.<br><sup>カマツチとは、珪酸分を多く含む土をモルタルに練りこんだ耐火モルタルのことだ。</sup><br><sup>Kamatsuchi is a refractory mortar made by kneading soil containing a lot of silicic acid into a mortar.</sup></p>
<p id="L17">It was made from a whitish soil found in the mountains, which is essential for making charcoal kilns.<br><sup>山で見つけた白みがかった土を使って作ったもので、炭窯作りには必要不可欠なものである。</sup><br><sup>It is made from white soil found in the mountains and is indispensable for making charcoal kilns.</sup></p>
<p id="L18"><br></p>
<p id="L19">The reason why Valletta asked Ichirō to make fire bricks this time is because Japanese fire bricks are much higher quality than the ones she makes herself.<br><sup>今回バレッタが一良に耐火レンガを頼んだ理由は、日本の耐火レンガのほうが自分で作るものよりもはるかに高品質だからだ。</sup><br><sup>The reason why Valletta asked Ichira to buy firebricks is that Japanese firebricks are of much higher quality than their own.</sup></p>
<p id="L20">If you just want to make a lump iron furnace to refine iron from iron ore, refractory bricks made of shaped and fired kamatsuchi are fine.<br><sup>鉄鉱石から鉄を精製する<ruby><rb>塊鉄炉</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>かいてつろ</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>を作るだけならば、カマツチを整形して焼成した耐火レンガでも問題ない。</sup><br><sup>It is not a problem to make a solid iron furnace from iron ore, but a firebrick made from a shaped kamatsuchi.</sup></p>
<p id="L21">However, Baretta's intentions were different.<br><sup>だが、バレッタの思惑は別のところにあった。</sup><br><sup>But Valletta's intentions were elsewhere.</sup></p>
<p id="L22"><br></p>
<p id="L23">"Oh, you can run to the mountains in an hour? ...... So you found iron ore in the mountains?"<br><sup>「ああ、走って１時間で山まで行けるんでしたっけ……てことは、山で鉄鉱石を見つけたんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, we can run to the mountain in an hour... did you find iron ore in the mountain?"</sup></p>
<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25">"Yes. I found a large vein of iron."<br><sup>「はい。鉄の大鉱脈を見つけました」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I found a great iron vein."</sup></p>
<p id="L26"><br></p>
<p id="L27">...... Are you serious?"<br><sup>「……マジで？」</sup><br><sup>"...really?"</sup></p>
<p id="L28"><br></p>
<p id="L29">I'm serious.<br><sup>「マジです」</sup><br><sup>"Seriously,"</sup></p>
<p id="L30"><br></p>
<p id="L31">Baretta smiled at Ichiran, who was surprised to see her eyes peeled.<br><sup>目を剥いて驚いている一良に、バレッタが微笑む。</sup><br><sup>Valletta smiles at Ichira, who is surprised with her eyes peeled off.</sup></p>
<p id="L32"><br></p>
<p id="L33">I found it by accident along a river in the mountains. There was a lot of crushed iron ore on the riverbank. I think it was probably crushed in a flash flood or something, and gradually accumulated.<br><sup>「山の川沿いで偶然見つけました。砕けた鉄鉱石も、河原に沢山落ちてましたよ。たぶん鉄砲水か何かで砕けたものが、少しずつ貯まっていったんだと思います」</sup><br><sup>"I happened to find it along the mountain stream.A lot of broken iron ore fell on the river.Perhaps something broken by flash water was gradually accumulated."</sup></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35">Can you tell me if there is such a place ...... and where it is located?"<br><sup>「そんなところがあるんですか……どの辺りにあるのか、教えてもらえますか？」</sup><br><sup>"Is there such a place... can you tell me where it is?"</sup></p>
<p id="L36"><br></p>
<p id="L37">When Kazuyoshi held out the file with the map, Baretta flipped through it and opened it to a page containing a map of the mountainous area.<br><sup>一良が地図の入ったファイルを差し出すと、バレッタはぱらぱらとめくって山岳地帯の地図が入っているページを開いた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira handed out a file containing maps, Valletta flipped over to open a page containing maps of mountainous areas.</sup></p>
<p id="L38">The map was a reproduction copied on A3 paper.<br><sup>地図は、Ａ３用紙にコピーした複製品だ。</sup><br><sup>The map is a copy of A3 paper.</sup></p>
<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">"There are iron deposits all along this river. There are iron deposits all along this river, and I'm pretty sure they match the appearance of the 'striped iron deposits' in the book.<br><sup>「この川沿い一帯に鉄鉱脈があります。本に載っていた『縞状鉄鉱床』の写真と外観が完全に一致していたので、間違いないと思います」</sup><br><sup>"There's an iron vein along this river, and I'm sure it's because the picture of the striped iron deposit in the book matches exactly."</sup></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42">Baretta ran her finger along one of the rivers on the map and opened the book titled "History of Metal Refining" that was sitting beside her.<br><sup>バレッタは地図に描かれている一本の川に指を這わせると、傍らに置いてあった『金属精錬の歴史』というタイトルの本を開いた。</sup><br><sup>Valletta crawled her finger over a river on the map and opened a book titled "History of Metal Refining" beside her.</sup></p>
<p id="L43">The page I opened to contained a color photograph named "Striped Iron Deposit".<br><sup>開いたページには、『縞状鉄鉱床』と名が付いたカラー写真が記載されている。</sup><br><sup>The open page contains color photographs named "striped iron deposits."</sup></p>
<p id="L44">This is a shot of a rock wall with red and black stripes.<br><sup>赤黒い縞模様の岩壁を撮影したものだ。</sup><br><sup>This is a photograph of a red-black striped rock wall.</sup></p>
<p id="L45"><br></p>
<p id="L46">"It's about here. There was a vein of ore running upstream, and there was a lot of crushed iron ore on the riverbank on one side.<br><sup>「だいたいこの辺りです。川の上流まで鉱脈が続いていて、片側にある河原には砕けた鉄鉱石が沢山落ちてました」</sup><br><sup>"It's about here.The vein continued to the upper reaches of the river, and a lot of broken iron ore fell on the riverbed on one side."</sup></p>
<p id="L47"><br></p>
<p id="L48">"Hmmm... this river connects to the village. ...... The reserves are going to be amazing."<br><sup>「ふむふむ、この川は村まで繋がってるのか……埋蔵量がすごいことになっていそうですね」</sup><br><sup>"Well, is this river connected to the village... it seems that the reserves are going to be very large?"</sup></p>
<p id="L49"><br></p>
<p id="L50">If we cut down the rock face, I think we can mine quite a bit of it. There's an awful lot of stuff that's fallen into the riverbed alone, so we can use it all we want."<br><sup>「岩肌を切り崩せばかなりの量が採掘できると思います。河原に落ちてるものだけでもすごい量なので、使い放題ですよ」</sup><br><sup>"If you cut down the rock surface, you'll be able to mine a considerably.The amount of things falling on the river is huge, so you can use them as much as you want."</sup></p>
<p id="L51"><br></p>
<p id="L52">That's great. I've been thinking about how to introduce steelmaking technology, so it's a relief to know there's material nearby. If you decide to mine it, can I have a little help?"<br><sup>「それはすごい。製鉄技術の導入をどうしようかと考えていたので、近場に材料があると知ってほっとしました。もし採掘することになったら、少し手伝ってもらってもいいですか？」</sup><br><sup>"That's great.I was thinking about how to introduce ironmaking technology, so I was relieved to know that there were materials nearby.If it were to be mined, would you mind helping me a little?"</sup></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54">"Yes!　I've been exploring a lot in the mountains lately, so I'll show you around sometime!"<br><sup>「はい！　最近山の中をあちこち探索してるんで、今度色々と案内しますね！」</sup><br><sup>"Yes! I've been exploring the mountains lately, so I'll show you a lot of things next time!"</sup></p>
<p id="L55"><br></p>
<p id="L56">Kazuyoshi nodded to Baretta, who nodded with a rather happy expression, and then looked down at the note paper again.<br><sup>やたらと嬉しそうに頷くバレッタに一良は頷くと、再びメモ紙に目を落とすのだった。</sup><br><sup>Kazura nodded to Valletta, who nodded happily, and looked down again at the memo paper.</sup></p>
<p id="L57"><br></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59"><br></p>
<p id="L60">"Wow, this is awesome. ......"<br><sup>「うお、こりゃすげえ……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, this is amazing..."</sup></p>
<p id="L61"><br></p>
<p id="L62">Preparing to leave for Japan, Kazuyoshi let out a shout of amazement as he walked out the front door of the mansion.<br><sup>日本への出発準備を整えた一良は、屋敷の玄関を出たところで驚嘆の声を漏らした。</sup><br><sup>When he was ready to leave for Japan, he let out a sigh of surprise as he left the front door of the house.</sup></p>
<p id="L63">Last night it was too dark to see clearly, but now that it's light, we can see the whole village clearly.<br><sup>昨晩は暗くてよく分からなかったのだが、明るい今なら村の全容がはっきりと見て取れる。</sup><br><sup>It was dark last night and I didn't understand well, but now that it's bright, I can see the whole village clearly.</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">Starting with the mortar waterway that runs through the village, there are water mills of various sizes set up here and there.<br><sup>村の中を流れるモルタル製の水路を初めとして、あちこちに設置されている大小さまざまな水車。</sup><br><sup>Watermills of all sizes are installed here and there, starting with mortar waterways that flow through the village.</sup></p>
<p id="L66">Wooden fences surround the village, and watchtowers are set up on all sides.<br><sup>村をぐるりと取り囲むように作られた木柵と、その四方に設置された見張り塔。</sup><br><sup>A wooden fence and a watchtower surrounding the village.</sup></p>
<p id="L67">There were also several new buildings under construction, with large amounts of wood, presumably columns and wall panels, lying on the ground.<br><sup>新しく建築中の建物も何軒か見られ、柱や壁板とみられる木材が大量に地面に横たえられていた。</sup><br><sup>Several new buildings were also being built, and a large amount of wood, believed to be pillars and wallboards, lay on the ground.</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">Here's your lunch, Kazura.<br><sup>「カズラさん、お弁当です」</sup><br><sup>"Here's your lunch, Kazura."</sup></p>
<p id="L70"><br></p>
<p id="L71">While Kazuyoshi was looking out over the village, Baretta came out of the mansion carrying a wooden lunch box.<br><sup>一良が村の様子を眺めていると、バレッタが木の弁当箱を持って屋敷から出てきた。</sup><br><sup>As Ichira watched the village, Valletta came out of the house with a wooden lunch box.</sup></p>
<p id="L72">When I made breakfast, he quickly made it and packed it with me.<br><sup>朝食を作るときに、一緒にぱぱっと作って詰めてくれたものだ。</sup><br><sup>When I made breakfast, they used to make it and pack it together.</sup></p>
<p id="L73"><br></p>
<p id="L74">Do you think you'll be home in time for dinner?"<br><sup>「お夕飯までには帰ってこれそうですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Will you be back by dinner?"</sup></p>
<p id="L75"><br></p>
<p id="L76">Yes, I don't have any plans that will take much time, and I think I can come back."<br><sup>「そうですね、特に時間がかかりそうな予定もないですし、戻ってこれると思います」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I don't have any particular plans to take long, and I think I can come back."</sup></p>
<p id="L77"><br></p>
<p id="L78">Hearing his reply, Baretta smiled happily.<br><sup>その返事を聞き、バレッタは嬉しそうに微笑んだ。</sup><br><sup>When Valletta heard the answer, she smiled happily.</sup></p>
<p id="L79"><br></p>
<p id="L80">"Good. I'll be waiting to make you a feast."<br><sup>「よかった。ごちそう作って待ってますね」</sup><br><sup>"That's great. I'll be waiting for you to make a meal."</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">I'll try to be back as soon as I can. Is there anything else you need to buy in addition to what was on the list?"<br><sup>「なるべく早く戻ってくるようにしますね。リストに書いてあったもの以外に、追加で買ってくるものはないですか？」</sup><br><sup>"I'll try to come back as soon as possible.Is there anything else you would like to buy besides the ones on the list?"</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">I'm sure it's fine. ...... Oh, yeah. Your father was ranting about how much he wanted to drink that drink again.<br><sup>「たぶん大丈夫だと思いますけど……あ、そうだ。お父さんが、『あの酒がもう一度飲みたい』ってうわごとのように言ってました」</sup><br><sup>"I think it's all right, but... oh, that's right.My father said like a joke, 'I want to drink that drink again.'"</sup></p>
<p id="L85"><br></p>
<p id="L86">"Sake, huh? Then I guess I'll have to get more than just sake."<br><sup>「酒ですか。そしたら日本酒以外にも色々と買ってくるか」</sup><br><sup>"Drink? Then I'll buy you a lot of other things besides sake."</sup></p>
<p id="L87"><br></p>
<p id="L88">Then, with Baretta waving goodbye, Kazuyoshi left the house.<br><sup>そうして、いってらっしゃい、と手を振るバレッタに見送られ、一良は屋敷を後にした。</sup><br><sup>Then, when Valletta waved goodbye, Ichira left the house.</sup></p>
<p id="L89"><br></p>
<p id="L90"><br></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">After seeing Irao off, Baretta went to the canal in the village to wash and do her laundry, and then came to the encampment outside the village.<br><sup>一良を見送った後、バレッタは村の中の水路で洗い物と洗濯を済ませると、村の外の野営地へとやってきた。</sup><br><sup>After seeing Ichira off, Valletta washed and washed the water in the village waterway and came to the camp outside the village.</sup></p>
<p id="L93">I asked a nearby soldier to call Isaac and turned my attention to the scenery in the encampment.<br><sup>手近にいた兵士にアイザックを呼んでもらい、野営地内の景色に目を向ける。</sup><br><sup>A soldier nearby calls Isaac and looks at the scenery of the camp.</sup></p>
<p id="L94"><br></p>
<p id="L95">Many of the soldiers were in plain clothes, and only a few were in armor.<br><sup>兵士たちは私服の者が多く、鎧を着込んでいる者は少数だった。</sup><br><sup>Most of the soldiers were plain-clothes, and only a few wore armor.</sup></p>
<p id="L96">A laid-back atmosphere prevailed in the encampment as everyone seemed to be enjoying their temporary vacation.<br><sup>のんびりとした雰囲気が野営地には流れており、皆が臨時休暇を楽しんでいるようだ。</sup><br><sup>There is a relaxed atmosphere in the camp, and everyone seems to be enjoying a temporary vacation.</sup></p>
<p id="L97">We could see a few people walking towards the river with fishing rods in their hands, and a few others heading towards the nearby forest.<br><sup>釣竿を手に持って川の方へと歩いていく者たちや、近場の森に向かう者たちの姿もちらほらと見られる。</sup><br><sup>People walking toward the river with fishing rods in their hands and those heading to nearby forests can be seen everywhere.</sup></p>
<p id="L98">Those heading for the forest were looking for Arcadian worms, a specialty of the area.<br><sup>森に向かう者たちのお目当ては、この付近の特産品であるアルカディアン虫だ。</sup><br><sup>Those who go to the forest are looking for Arcadians, a specialty of this neighborhood.</sup></p>
<p id="L99"><br></p>
<p id="L100">As Baretta was watching this scene, Isaac in his armor walked up shortly after.<br><sup>そんな光景をバレッタが眺めていると、ほどなくして鎧姿のアイザックが歩いてきた。</sup><br><sup>As Valletta watched the scene, Isaac, dressed in armor, walked in.</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">Good morning, Mr. Isaac."<br><sup>「アイザックさん、おはようございます」</sup><br><sup>"Good morning, Mr. Isaac,"</sup></p>
<p id="L103"><br></p>
<p id="L104">Isaac smiled as Baretta bowed her head.<br><sup>バレッタがぺこりと頭を下げると、アイザックは笑顔を見せた。</sup><br><sup>Isaac smiled as Valletta bowed his head.</sup></p>
<p id="L105"><br></p>
<p id="L106">"Good morning. Has Lady Kazura gone to the Kingdom of God yet?"<br><sup>「おはようございます。カズラ様はもう神の国へ行かれたのですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Good morning.Has Kazura gone to God's land yet?"</sup></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">Yes, I've just left.<br><sup>「はい、今出かけたところです」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I have just left."</sup></p>
<p id="L109"><br></p>
<p id="L110">"I see. Well, shall we get started?"<br><sup>「そうですか。では、早速始めますか？」</sup><br><sup>"I see. Shall we start right away?"</sup></p>
<p id="L111"><br></p>
<p id="L112">Please do. But before I do, there are a few things I'd like to discuss with you. ......"<br><sup>「お願いします。でも、その前にいくつか相談したいことがあって……」</sup><br><sup>"I beg of course.But before that, I'd like to talk to you about a few things..."</sup></p>
<p id="L113"><br></p>
<p id="L114">"All right. Let's hear it in my tent."<br><sup>「分かりました。私の天幕でお聞きしましょう」</sup><br><sup>"All right.I'll ask you in my tent."</sup></p>
<p id="L115"><br></p>
<p id="L116">Isaac said, and began to walk through the encampment with Baretta.<br><sup>アイザックはそう言うと、バレッタを連れて野営地の中を進み始めた。</sup><br><sup>When Isaac said so, he began to take Valletta through the camp.</sup></p>
<p id="L117">On the way, some of the soldiers who saw the two of them blurted out such blatantly misunderstood phrases as, "Master Isaac, you brought a pretty girl with you," or "Master Isaac does it when he has to. I'm going to go talk to him.<br><sup>途中、２人を見た兵士たちが、「アイザック様、かわいい娘連れて来たな」とか、「アイザック様もやる時はやるんだな。俺も声掛けに行ってこよう」などと、あからさまに勘違いした台詞をぼそぼそと漏らしていた。</sup><br><sup>On the way, the soldiers who saw them said, "Mr. Isaac, you brought a pretty girl," and "Mr. Isaac does it when he does it, too.I'll go and talk to you, too," he said, murmuring his overtly misunderstood lines.</sup></p>
<p id="L118"><br></p>
<p id="L119">Isaac walked quickly and moved to his tent without showing any sign of concern.<br><sup>アイザックは気にする素振りも見せずにさっさと歩き、自分の天幕へと移動する。</sup><br><sup>Isaac walks quickly without showing any signs of concern and moves to his tent.</sup></p>
<p id="L120"><br></p>
<p id="L121">"This way, please. Let's leave the entrance open."<br><sup>「こちらへどうぞ。入り口は開け放っておきましょう」</sup><br><sup>"Come this way, please.Let's leave the door open."</sup></p>
<p id="L122"><br></p>
<p id="L123">Once Isaac was in the tent, he opened the entrance and secured it tightly with a string.<br><sup>アイザックは天幕に入ると、入り口を開いて紐でしっかりと固定した。</sup><br><sup>When Isaac entered the tent, he opened the door and secured it with a rope.</sup></p>
<p id="L124">He pulled out a chair at a simple table in the back and offered it to Baretta.<br><sup>奥にある簡易テーブルの椅子を引き、バレッタに勧める。</sup><br><sup>Pull the chair at the back of the simple table and recommend it to Valletta.</sup></p>
<p id="L125"><br></p>
<p id="L126">Let's hear what you have to say, then. I'll help you as much as I can, so please tell me anything you need."<br><sup>「それでは、用件を聞きましょう。できる限り協力しますので、何でもおっしゃってください」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I'll ask you what you want.I'll do my best to help you, so please let me know."</sup></p>
<p id="L127"><br></p>
<p id="L128">Isaac smiled cheerfully as he sat Baretta down and then sat down in the chair himself.<br><sup>バレッタを座らせてから自身も椅子に座り、アイザックは朗らかな笑顔を見せた。</sup><br><sup>After Valletta sat down, Isaac himself sat down in a chair and smiled brightly.</sup></p>
<p id="L129">Baretta, who had been feeling a little nervous, relaxed her shoulders at the sight of Isaac.<br><sup>少し緊張気味だったバレッタは、そんなアイザックの様子に肩の力を緩めた。</sup><br><sup>Valletta, who was a little nervous, relaxed her shoulders at Isaac's appearance.</sup></p>
<p id="L130"><br></p>
<p id="L131">Thank you very much. First of all, I would like to ask you to arrange for a 'wax stone'.<br><sup>「ありがとうございます。まず１つ目の相談なんですが、『ろう石』の手配をお願いしたいんです」</sup><br><sup>"Thank you very much.First of all, I'd like to ask you to arrange a wax stone."</sup></p>
<p id="L132"><br></p>
<p id="L133">It's a wax stone. Do you use it to write with?"<br><sup>「ろう石ですか。文字を書くのに使うのですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Waxstone?Do you use it to write?"</sup></p>
<p id="L134"><br></p>
<p id="L135">Duroishi is a soft ore with a waxy, milky white color.<br><sup>ろう石とは、蝋のような乳白色をしたやわらかい鉱石のことだ。</sup><br><sup>Pallite is a soft, waxy ore.</sup></p>

<p id="L286">However, right after that, he was beaten up as hard as he could by an enraged Arondo.<br><sup>だが、その直後激昂したアロンドに思い切り殴り飛ばされてしまった。</sup><br><sup>But soon afterwards, Alond, who was furious, beat him to his heart's content.</sup></p>
<p id="L287">Havel was completely deflated by the sudden act of Arondo, who had usually been relatively friendly to her, and after that he just watched Marie from a distance.<br><sup>普段は比較的友好的に接してきていたアロンドの突然の行為にハベルは完全に萎縮してしまい、その後はマリーを遠巻きに見守るだけになってしまった。</sup><br><sup>Alond's sudden behavior, which had usually been relatively friendly to him, completely shrank Hubbard, and after that all he had to do was watch Marie in a distance.</sup></p>
<p id="L288"><br></p>
<p id="L289">While the other servants pretended not to see the damage for fear of it spreading, my mother was the only one who took a stand and protected Marie.<br><sup>他の使用人たちも被害の飛び火を恐れて見て見ぬふりをするなか、母だけは身を挺してマリーを守ってくれていた。</sup><br><sup>While other servants turned a blind eye for fear of the fire, only her mother leaned forward to protect Marie.</sup></p>
<p id="L290">Her mother, too, was sold off by my father's knoll about five years ago because she was prone to illness.<br><sup>その母も、５年ほど前に病気がちなのを理由に、父のノールによって売り飛ばされてしまった。</sup><br><sup>Her mother was sold off by her father, Noor, about five years ago because she was sick.</sup></p>
<p id="L291"><br></p>
<p id="L292">It was shortly after that that Havel enlisted in the army.<br><sup>ハベルが軍に入隊したのは、その直後だった。</sup><br><sup>It was not long after Havel joined the army.</sup></p>
<p id="L293">Because he enlisted during the war, he went to the battlefield after receiving quickening training in the military and did not return home until the armistice.<br><sup>戦時中の入隊ということもあって、入隊後は軍部で速成訓練を受けた後に戦場へと赴き、休戦まで家に戻ってくることはなかった。</sup><br><sup>Since he joined the army during the war, he went to the battlefield after receiving quick training from the military and never returned home until the armistice.</sup></p>
<p id="L294">After returning from the war, Havel began to proudly defend Arondo when he saw him being hard on Marie.<br><sup>戦地から戻ってからは、ハベルはアロンドがマリーに対して辛く当たっているのを目にすると、堂々と庇うようになった。</sup><br><sup>After returning from the battlefield, Havel began to protect Alondo proudly when he saw her hard on Marie.</sup></p>
<p id="L295">As a matter of course, they got into many fistfights, but no violent incidents have occurred since they were both beaten to a pulp by Noor who couldn't see what was going on.<br><sup>当然のように何度も殴り合いの喧嘩になったが、見かねたノールに２人とも殴り飛ばされてからは、暴力沙汰は起こっていない。</sup><br><sup>Naturally, there were many fistfights, but since Norr, who couldn't see them, they've both been beaten off, there's no violence.</sup></p>
<p id="L296"><br></p>
<p id="L297">Incidentally, the next day after the fistfight, Arondo treated Havel like he was fine, as if the fight had never happened.<br><sup>ちなみに、殴り合いの喧嘩をした次の日には、アロンドは喧嘩などなかったかのようにけろっとした様子でハベルに接していた。</sup><br><sup>By the way, the next day after the fistfight, Alondo treated Hubbell as if there had been no fight.</sup></p>
<p id="L298">However, there were many times when he would make snide remarks and tease me, which left me feeling frustrated.<br><sup>といっても、癇に触るような軽口を叩いてきたりからかってくることも多々あったので、ハベルとしてはもやもやしっぱなしであったのだが。</sup><br><sup>However, there were many times when he made fun of me and made fun of me, which made me feel uneasy as a haberdasher.</sup></p>
<p id="L299"><br></p>
<p id="L300">"Yes, ......."<br><sup>「はい……」</sup><br><sup>"Yes..."</sup></p>
<p id="L301"><br></p>
<p id="L302">Without paying attention to Marie, who nodded with a complicated expression, Havel swung his fishing rod with his face to the river.<br><sup>複雑そうな表情で頷くマリーを気にするでもなく、ハベルは川に顔を向けたまま釣竿を振るう。</sup><br><sup>Instead of worrying about Marie nodding with a complicated expression, Hubbell swings his fishing rod with his face facing the river.</sup></p>
<p id="L303"><br></p>
<p id="L304">You seem to be quite busy every day, are you feeling okay?　If you feel sluggish or sick, tell Kazura-sama or Eira-san right away.<br><sup>「毎日かなり忙しそうだが、身体は大丈夫か？　だるかったり体調を崩しそうだなと感じたら、すぐにカズラ様やエイラさんに言うんだぞ」</sup><br><sup>"You look pretty busy every day, but are you okay?If you feel tired or sick, you'll tell Kazura and Ayla right away."</sup></p>
<p id="L305"><br></p>
<p id="L306">It's all right. Ever since I started working at Master Nalson's mansion, I've been feeling really good every day.<br><sup>「それは大丈夫です。ナルソン様のお屋敷で働くようになってから、何だか毎日すごく身体の調子が良くて」</sup><br><sup>"That's all right.I've been feeling very well every day since I started working at Mr. Naruson's mansion."</sup></p>
<p id="L307"><br></p>
<p id="L308">"I see. Are things going well with the other servants?"<br><sup>「そうか。他の使用人たちとは上手くいっているか？」</sup><br><sup>"I see. Are you getting along well with the other servants?"</sup></p>
<p id="L309"><br></p>
<p id="L310">"Yes, everyone has been very nice to me. Especially Eira, she cares so much for me. ......"<br><sup>「はい、皆さんすごく良くしてくれます。特に、エイラさんがとても気にかけてくれて……」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, everyone is very nice to me.Especially, Ayla cares a lot about me..."</sup></p>
<p id="L311"><br></p>
<p id="L312">"Eira-san seems to be a very caring person. You're lucky to have such a kind senior."<br><sup>「エイラさんは面倒見がよさそうだもんな。優しい先輩でよかったじゃないか」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Ayla seems to take good care of him.I'm glad you're a kind senior."</sup></p>
<p id="L313"><br></p>
<p id="L314">"Yes ......, thank you so much for helping me. What can I say to thank you? ......"<br><sup>「はい……あの、私なんかのために本当にありがとうございます。何とお礼を言ったらいいか……」</sup><br><sup>"Yes... you know, thank you very much for me.I don't know how to thank you..."</sup></p>
<p id="L315"><br></p>
<p id="L316">Marie glanced at him as if to see his face, and Havel smiled as he kept his eyes on the water.<br><sup>ちらちらと顔色を窺うように見てくるマリーに、ハベルは水面に目を向けたまま苦笑した。</sup><br><sup>Hubbell smiled bitterly at Mary, who glanced at her.</sup></p>
<p id="L317"><br></p>
<p id="L318">I'd like it if you'd be a little more tactful with me. Well, I'm not saying you have to."<br><sup>「俺にはもう少し砕けた態度で接してくれると嬉しいんだけどな。まあ、無理にとは言わないけどさ」</sup><br><sup>"I wish you would treat me in a more casual manner.Well, I won't force you to do it."</sup></p>
<p id="L319"><br></p>
<p id="L320">"I'm sorry, too!　Uh, let's see, ...... brother ......."<br><sup>「も、申し訳ございません！　え、えっと……兄さん……」</sup><br><sup>"But I'm sorry!"Well... brother..."</sup></p>
<p id="L321"><br></p>
<p id="L322">Havel patted the head of Marie, who called him brother in a panicked manner.<br><sup>慌てた様子で兄と呼んでくるマリーの頭を、ハベルはぽんぽんと撫でた。</sup><br><sup>Hubbell patted Mary's head, who called her brother in a hurry.</sup></p>
<p id="L323">He was filled with a sense of helplessness, but he did not show it on his face.<br><sup>心中はやるせない気持ちでいっぱいだが、それを表情に出したりはしない。</sup><br><sup>My heart is full of helplessness, but I don't show it on my face.</sup></p>
<p id="L324"><br></p>
<p id="L325">"Look, you can't catch fish with a fishing rod like that. The fish are in the water. Did you know that?"<br><sup>「ほら、そうやって釣竿を持っていても魚は釣れないぞ。魚は水の中にいるんだ。知ってたか？」</sup><br><sup>"You know, you can't catch a fish even if you hold a fishing rod like that.The fish is in the water.Did you know that?"</sup></p>
<p id="L326"><br></p>
<p id="L327">"Yes, yes!　Yotto......!　Needle in my clothes!<br><sup>「は、はい！　よっと……あ！　針が服に！」</sup><br><sup>"Yes! Yay... Oh! The needle is on my clothes!"</sup></p>
<p id="L328"><br></p>
<p id="L329">Marie was in a panic as she swung the whole rod around, the hook caught in her clothes.<br><sup>服に引っかかった針を竿ごと振り回して、マリーは慌てふためいている。</sup><br><sup>Marie was flustered as she swung the needle stuck on her clothes with the pole.</sup></p>
<p id="L330"><br></p>
<p id="L331">What do you do when you catch yourself ......?"<br><sup>「自分を釣ってどうするんだよ……」</sup><br><sup>"What are you going to do with yourself?"</sup></p>
<p id="L332"><br></p>
<p id="L333">Havel put his own fishing rod by his side and held Marie down to remove the hook.<br><sup>ハベルはやれやれと自分の釣竿を傍らに置くと、マリーを押さえつけて針を外すのだった。</sup><br><sup>Hubbard put his fishing rod beside him, and pressed Mary to release the needle.</sup></p>
