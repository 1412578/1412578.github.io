<p id="L1">The next morning.<br><sup>次の日の朝。</sup><br><sup>The next morning.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">After finishing breakfast, they all went outside the mansion.<br><sup>朝食を済ませた一同は、屋敷の外に出ていた。</sup><br><sup>After breakfast, they all went out of the house.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">Kazuyoshi is changing into Japanese clothes to go back to Japan.<br><sup>一良は日本に戻るため、日本製の洋服に着替えている。</sup><br><sup>Ichira is changing into Japanese clothes to go back to Japan.</sup></p>
<p id="L4"><br></p>
<p id="L5">"Then take care of the rest. I'll be back in the evening."<br><sup>「それじゃあ、後のことはお願いします。夜には戻ってきますね」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I'd like to ask you the rest.I'll be back at night."</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">"Yes. I'll have dinner ready and waiting for you."<br><sup>「はい。お夕飯用意して待ってますね」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I'll be waiting for dinner."</sup></p>
<p id="L8"><br></p>
<p id="L9">As usual, Kazuyoshi said goodbye to everyone and got into a farm cart parked in the corner of the property.<br><sup>いつものように一良は皆に別れを告げ、敷地の隅に停めてあった農業用運搬車に乗り込んだ。</sup><br><sup>As usual, Ichira said goodbye to everyone and got into an agricultural truck parked in the corner of the site.</sup></p>
<p id="L10">Insert the key and start the engine.<br><sup>キーを挿し込み、エンジンをかける。</sup><br><sup>Insert the key and start the engine.</sup></p>
<p id="L11">With a characteristic explosion, Kazuyoshi left toward the thicket.<br><sup>特徴的な爆音を響かせて、一良は雑木林の方へと去って行った。</sup><br><sup>With a distinctive explosion, Ichira left for the woods.</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">"'Well, let us go and fetch the artisans. ...... Lady Lise?"<br><sup>「さてと、私たちは職人さんたちを迎えに行きましょう。……リーゼ様？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, let's go get the craftsmen....Mr. Liese?"</sup></p>
<p id="L14"><br></p>
<p id="L15">Baretta tilts her head at Lise, who is staring dumbfounded at Ichirō's back as he leaves in the carrier.<br><sup>運搬車に乗って去っていく一良の背を唖然とした様子で見つめているリーゼに、バレッタが首を傾げる。</sup><br><sup>Valletta tilts her head to Liese, who looks blankly at Ichira's back as she leaves in a carriage.</sup></p>
<p id="L16"><br></p>
<p id="L17">"What the hell is that ...... I've never seen a ride like that before.<br><sup>「な、なんなのあれ……あんな乗り物初めて見るんだけど」</sup><br><sup>"Well, what... I've never seen such a ride before."</sup></p>
<p id="L18"><br></p>
<p id="L19">"I heard it was called an agricultural transport vehicle. I was also surprised when I saw it for the first time.<br><sup>「農業用運搬車っていうらしいですよ。私も初めて見たときはびっくりしました」</sup><br><sup>"I hear it's called an agricultural truck.I was surprised when I first saw it."</sup></p>
<p id="L20"><br></p>
<p id="L21">"Yeah, yeah, .......<br><sup>「そ、そう……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, yes..."</sup></p>
<p id="L22"><br></p>
<p id="L23">After watching Ichiran walk away for a while, Baretta and the others headed back to the encampment to pick up the bricklayers.<br><sup>そのまま離れていく一良をしばらく見送り、バレッタたちはレンガ職人たちを迎えに野営地へと向かうのだった。</sup><br><sup>After seeing Ichira off for a while, the Valetas headed for the camp to pick up the brickworkers.</sup></p>
<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25"><br></p>
<p id="L26"><br></p>
<p id="L27">A few minutes later, the three of them, along with a group of craftsmen, were in front of a brick kiln being built in a corner of the village.<br><sup>数十分後。３人は職人たちと一緒に、村の隅に作られているレンガ窯の前にいた。</sup><br><sup>After a few minutes, the three were with the craftsmen in front of a brick kiln built in the corner of the village.</sup></p>
<p id="L28">The kiln is currently not working and the contents are empty.<br><sup>現在窯は動いておらず、中身もからっぽだ。</sup><br><sup>The kiln is not working at the moment, and the contents are empty.</sup></p>
<p id="L29">A brick tower, a little over three meters high, stands nearby.<br><sup>すぐ近くには、高さが３メートル少々のレンガ造りの塔が建っている。</sup><br><sup>Nearby stands a three-meter-high brick tower.</sup></p>
<p id="L30">It was a small charcoal blast furnace made of firebricks, built by Barletta.<br><sup>バレッタが造った、耐火レンガ製の小型木炭高炉だ。</sup><br><sup>It is a small charcoal blast furnace made of firebrick made by Valletta.</sup></p>
<p id="L31">A water wheel was set up right next to it, connected to the skin puff.<br><sup>すぐ隣には水車が設置されており、皮のふいごと連結されていた。</sup><br><sup>A waterwheel was placed right next to it and connected to a bellows.</sup></p>
<p id="L32"><br></p>
<p id="L33">"This thing is huge. Is that a new type of furnace?"<br><sup>「こりゃでかいな。新型の炉か？」</sup><br><sup>"That's a big deal.Is it a new furnace?"</sup></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35">The master bricklayer asks Valletta as he looks up at the tower.<br><sup>レンガ職人の親方が、塔を見上げながらバレッタに問う。</sup><br><sup>The master brickman asks Valletta, looking up at the tower.</sup></p>
<p id="L36">Alongside them, the apprentice artisans stared at the tower.<br><sup>その横に並ぶようにして、弟子の職人たちが塔をじろじろと眺めていた。</sup><br><sup>Next to it, the apprentices' craftsmen stared at the tower.</sup></p>
<p id="L37">Earlier, he had been rolling his eyes at the giant vegetables growing in the village fields, but his interest seemed to have already shifted to us.<br><sup>先ほどまでは村の畑に生えている巨大野菜を見て目を丸くしていたのだが、すでに興味はこちらに移っているようだ。</sup><br><sup>Until a while ago, I was wide-eyed at the huge vegetables growing in the village field, but my interest seems to have shifted to this.</sup></p>
<p id="L38">Incidentally, he explained that the huge size of the vegetables was due to the use of soil from the forest of Kudan, which is strongly blessed by Glacior.<br><sup>ちなみに、野菜の巨大さについては、グレイシオールの加護を強く得ている<ruby><rb>件</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>くだん</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>の森の土を使ったと説明してある。</sup><br><sup>As for the size of the vegetables, it is explained that they were made of woodland soil, which was strongly protected by Graciol.</sup></p>
<p id="L39">Everyone didn't seem to have any doubts, and they all agreed, "I see.<br><sup>皆は特に疑う様子もなく、「なるほど」と一様に納得していた。</sup><br><sup>There was no sign of doubt, and everyone agreed with him, "I see.</sup></p>
<p id="L40"><br></p>
<p id="L41">"Let's see, this is a charcoal blast furnace. ......<br><sup>「えっと、これは木炭高炉といって……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, this is a charcoal blast furnace..."</sup></p>
<p id="L42"><br></p>
<p id="L43">With that, Baretta turned her attention to Zirconia.<br><sup>バレッタはそう言いながら、ジルコニアに目を向けた。</sup><br><sup>said Valletta, turning to zirconia.</sup></p>
<p id="L44">Zirconia, who had been looking up at the blast furnace like everyone else, nodded when she noticed his gaze.<br><sup>皆と同様に高炉を見上げていたジルコニアは、その視線に気づくと頷いてみせた。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia, who was looking up at the blast furnace like everyone else, nodded when she noticed his gaze.</sup></p>
<p id="L45"><br></p>
<p id="L46">"It's a furnace that can melt metal at a higher temperature than a normal furnace. As soon as we have enough refractory bricks, we'll build one in the Isteria."<br><sup>「通常の炉よりも高温で金属を溶かすことができる炉です。耐火レンガがそろい次第、イステリアにも造る予定です」</sup><br><sup>"It is a furnace that can melt metal at higher temperatures than ordinary furnaces.As soon as the firebricks are ready, we plan to build them in the exterior."</sup></p>
<p id="L47"><br></p>
<p id="L48">"Hmmm ......, is this waterwheel on the side for moving the bellows?"<br><sup>「ふむ……この横についている水車は、ふいごを動かすためのものかい？」</sup><br><sup>"Well... is this waterwheel beside you to move the bellows?"</sup></p>
<p id="L49"><br></p>
<p id="L50">"Yes. The bellows move automatically as the waterwheel rotates.<br><sup>「はい。水車の回転に合わせて、自動的にふいごが動く仕組みになっています」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, the bellows move automatically according to the rotation of the waterwheel."</sup></p>
<p id="L51"><br></p>
<p id="L52">"Oh, so it's automatic. How did you come up with something so convenient?"<br><sup>「ほう、自動的にか。よくこんな便利なものを考えたもんだな」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, automatically.How dare you think of such a convenient thing?"</sup></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54">The master nodded and began to squint and lick the walls of the blast furnace.<br><sup>親方は頷くと、目を細めて高炉の壁面を舐めるように眺め始めた。</sup><br><sup>The stable master nodded and began to look at the wall of the blast furnace with narrowed eyes.</sup></p>
<p id="L55">The disciples seemed to be doing the same, wandering around the blast furnace to check its shape.<br><sup>弟子たちも同じように、高炉の周りをうろうろと歩いては形を確かめているようだった。</sup><br><sup>The disciples, in the same way, seemed to be strolling about the blast furnace to see what it was like.</sup></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">"So, this is a brick kiln for firing highly refractory bricks used to build a blast furnace. It's used in the same way as a regular brick kiln, but it's made of high quality refractory bricks, so it can handle a lot of heat. ...... What's wrong?"<br><sup>「それで、こっちは高炉を造るのに使う耐火性の高いレンガを焼くためのレンガ窯です。使い方は普通のレンガ窯と同じですが、高品質な耐火レンガを使っているのでかなりの火力にも……あの、どうかしましたか？」</sup><br><sup>"So this is a brick kiln for burning fireproof bricks used to make blast furnaces.It's used the same way as an ordinary brick kiln, but it uses high-quality fire bricks, so it's quite firepower... well, what's the matter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">Noticing the craftsmen looking at the blast furnace with some sort of curious expression, Baretta tilted her head.<br><sup>何やらいぶかしげな表情で高炉を見ている職人たちに気づき、バレッタは首を傾げた。</sup><br><sup>Noticing the craftsmen looking at the blast furnace with some quizzical expression, Valletta tilted her head.</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">"Were these furnaces built by skilled craftsmen?"<br><sup>「これらの炉を造ったのは熟練の職人かい？」</sup><br><sup>"Was it a skilled craftsman who built these furnaces?"</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63">As the master said this, he looked at the brick kiln and the blast furnace alternately.<br><sup>親方はそう言いながら、レンガ窯と高炉を交互に見やる。</sup><br><sup>The stable master looked at the brick kiln and the blast furnace alternately.</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">"No, this was made by me and everyone in the village."<br><sup>「いえ、これは私と村の皆で造ったものです」</sup><br><sup>"No, it was made by me and the whole village."</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">When Valletta answered, the other craftsmen said, "I guess so," or "I knew it.<br><sup>バレッタが答えると、他の職人たちから「そうだろうな」とか「やっぱりな」といった声が漏れた。</sup><br><sup>When Valletta replied, other craftsmen said, "I guess so," and "As expected."</sup></p>
<p id="L68">The master nodded his head in agreement with them.<br><sup>親方も、彼らに同調するように頷いてみせる。</sup><br><sup>The stable master nods in agreement with them.</sup></p>
<p id="L69"><br></p>
<p id="L70">"It's not very good. The way the bricks are stacked is too messy. The brick kilns over here don't fire very well with this kind of construction, do they?"<br><sup>「ふうむ……こりゃあ、あんまりよくないな。レンガの積み方が雑すぎる。こっちのレンガ窯なんて、こんな造りじゃ火の回りがあんまりよくないんじゃないか？」</sup><br><sup>"Well... this isn't very good.The bricks are piled too roughly.Isn't this brick kiln so well built that it doesn't work very well?"</sup></p>
<p id="L71"><br></p>
<p id="L72">"U......, sorry."<br><sup>「う……す、すみません」</sup><br><sup>"Well... I'm sorry,"</sup></p>
<p id="L73"><br></p>
<p id="L74">"What about the bottom of the kiln?　Did you lay the logs down and clay them properly?"<br><sup>「窯底はどうなってるんだ？　ちゃんと丸太を敷き積めて粘土で固めたのか？」</sup><br><sup>"What's going on with the bottom of the kiln?"Did you lay logs on top of each other and solidify them with clay?"</sup></p>
<p id="L75"><br></p>
<p id="L76">"No, I didn't. I just cleared the ground and clayed it."<br><sup>「や、やってません。綺麗に整地して粘土で固めただけです」</sup><br><sup>"No, I didn't.I just leveled the ground clean and hardened it with clay."</sup></p>
<p id="L77"><br></p>
<p id="L78">"Have you sloped it towards the chimney?"<br><sup>「煙突に向けて傾斜はつけたか？」</sup><br><sup>"Have you slanted toward the chimney?"</sup></p>
<p id="L79"><br></p>
<p id="L80">"I didn't do that either. ......<br><sup>「それもやってないです……」</sup><br><sup>"I didn't do that either..."</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">Lise and Zirconia looked at each other as Baretta was being ruined at a great rate.<br><sup>すごい勢いでダメ出しされているバレッタに、リーゼとジルコニアはお互い顔を見合わせた。</sup><br><sup>Liese and Zirconia looked at each other at Valletta, who had been devastated with great force.</sup></p>
<p id="L83">He had a vague idea that if she had done it, everything would be perfect.<br><sup>一良に絶大な信頼を置かれている彼女がやったのならすべて完璧なのだろうと、何となくだが思っていたからだ。</sup><br><sup>Somehow, I thought that if she had done it, everything would be perfect.</sup></p>
<p id="L84"><br></p>
<p id="L85">"Master, you're out of line. ......"<br><sup>「親方、言いすぎですよ……」</sup><br><sup>"Sir, you're saying too much..."</sup></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">"Hmm?"<br><sup>「ん？」</sup><br><sup>"Huh?"</sup></p>
<p id="L88"><br></p>
<p id="L89">One of his students interrupted him, unable to bear the constant criticism.<br><sup>ひたすら続くダメ出しを見かねて、弟子の１人が口を挟む。</sup><br><sup>One of his disciples interrupts because he can't see the continuing damage.</sup></p>
<p id="L90">The master became impatient when he noticed a pensive Baretta and Lise and Zirconia staring at him.<br><sup>親方はしょんぼりしているバレッタと、その様子を見つめるリーゼとジルコニアに気づき、焦った表情になった。</sup><br><sup>The stable master noticed Valletta, who was depressed, and Liese and Zirconia staring at her, and looked impatient.</sup></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">"Oh, no!　I'd say it's pretty good for something I made with amateurs!　It looks pretty good!"<br><sup>「あ、いや！　素人と一緒に作ったにしちゃあ上出来とも言えるか！　けっこう様になってるしな！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, no! If I made it with an amateur, I can say it's good!"It's pretty good!"</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94">"......"<br><sup>「……」</sup><br><sup>「……」</sup></p>
<p id="L95"><br></p>
<p id="L96">"You girls did your best!　And if you look closely, it's not so bad, yeah!"<br><sup>「嬢ちゃんたちだって一生懸命やったんだもんな！　それによく見てみれば、そんなに悪くもないぞ、うん！」</sup><br><sup>"Even the girls worked hard!"And if you look closely, it's not that bad, is it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">As Baretta was clearly depressed, the master tried his best to put her in a good mood by giving her a follow-up that was not even a follow-up.<br><sup>あからさまにへこんでいるバレッタに、親方はフォローにもなっていないフォローを入れて必死にご機嫌をうかがう。</sup><br><sup>The stable master desperately checks on Valletta, who is clearly dented, by following her not even following her.</sup></p>
<p id="L99">He seems to be quite impatient inwardly, having made a comment that undermined Baretta, a zirconia endorsed craftsman.<br><sup>ジルコニアお墨付きの職人であるバレッタを貶めるような発言をしてしまい、内心かなり焦っているようだ。</sup><br><sup>He seemed to be in a great hurry to speak disparagingly of Valletta, a certified zirconia craftsman.</sup></p>
<p id="L100"><br></p>
<p id="L101">"Well, well, well. Can you show me how to burn these bricks?　I've made a lot of them, so it's going to be a big job.　Hahaha!"<br><sup>「じゃ、じゃあ、さっそくこのレンガの焼き方を教えてもらえるかい？　たくさん作ってきたから、大仕事になるぞこりゃあ！　わはは！」</sup><br><sup>"Well, then, can you tell me how to bake this brick right away?"I've made a lot of them, so it's going to be a big job!Hahaha!"</sup></p>
<p id="L102"><br></p>
<p id="L103">"Okay, ......."<br><sup>「分かりました……」</sup><br><sup>"All right..."</sup></p>
<p id="L104"><br></p>
<p id="L105">The bricklaying instruction began in a very delicate atmosphere.<br><sup>何とも微妙な空気のなか、レンガ造りの指導が始まるのだった。</sup><br><sup>The teaching of brickwork began in the most delicate atmosphere.</sup></p>
<p id="L106"><br></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108"><br></p>
<p id="L109">Meanwhile, back then.<br><sup>一方その頃。</sup><br><sup>On the other hand, at that time.</sup></p>
<p id="L110">After returning to Japan, Kazuyoshi sat on the porch of his mansion, making phone calls all over the place.<br><sup>日本に帰還した一良は、屋敷の縁側に座ってあちこちに電話をかけていた。</sup><br><sup>When he returned to Japan, he sat on the verandah of the house and called everywhere.</sup></p>
<p id="L111">I finished arranging for additional fertilizer, checked the progress of the construction plan, and checked with the main clerk at the home improvement store to see if they carried a certain product.<br><sup>追加の肥料の手配を済ませ、工事計画書の進捗具合を確認し、ホームセンターの主事店員にとある商品を取り扱っているか確認する。</sup><br><sup>Additional fertilizer arrangements have been completed, the progress of the construction plan is checked, and a staff member in charge of the home center is checked to see if they handle a certain product.</sup></p>
<p id="L112">After everything was done, he was about to put his phone in his pocket when he suddenly stopped.<br><sup>すべてを済ませて携帯電話をポケットにしまおうとして、ふとその動きを止めた。</sup><br><sup>I tried to finish everything and put my cell-phone in my pocket, but it suddenly stopped working.</sup></p>
<p id="L113"><br></p>
<p id="L114">"...... It's about time I heard it right.<br><sup>「……そろそろ、ちゃんと聞いておくか」</sup><br><sup>"...it's about time I listened carefully."</sup></p>
<p id="L115"><br></p>
<p id="L116">Then he looked at the screen of his cell phone again and made a call.<br><sup>そう言ってもう一度携帯電話の画面を見ると、電話をかけた。</sup><br><sup>Then I looked at my cell-phone screen again and called.</sup></p>
<p id="L117">A few calls later, the phone was connected.<br><sup>数コールして、電話が繋がった。</sup><br><sup>I made a few calls and got through.</sup></p>
<p id="L118"><br></p>
<p id="L119">"Oh, Dad?　Long time no see."<br><sup>「あ、父さん？　久しぶり」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, Dad? Long time no see."</sup></p>
<p id="L120"><br></p>
<p id="L121">"Hey, it hasn't been that long.<br><sup>『こら、久しぶり、じゃないだろ』</sup><br><sup>"It's been a long time, hasn't it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L122"><br></p>
<p id="L123">A voice that sounded like a mixture of relief and grumpiness came from the phone.<br><sup>安堵のなかに不機嫌さが混じったような声が、電話口から響く。</sup><br><sup>A voice mixed with displeasure echoed from the telephone.</sup></p>
<p id="L124"><br></p>
<p id="L125">"It's been over three months since I last called you. I told you to call me at least once a month.<br><sup>『最後に電話してから３カ月以上経ってるんだぞ。月一でいいから連絡寄越せって言っただろうが』</sup><br><sup>'It's been more than three months since I last called.I told you to contact me once a month.'</sup></p>
<p id="L126"><br></p>
<p id="L127">"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I've been a little out of touch. I've been a little out of touch, and I need to ask you something about it.<br><sup>「ごめんごめん。ちょっと連絡付かないところにいたんだ。んで、それについて父さんに聞きたいことがあるんだ」</sup><br><sup>"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.I was out of touch for a moment, so I'd like to ask my father about it."</sup></p>
<p id="L128"><br></p>
<p id="L129">Kazuyoshi prefaced his statement with that and took a breath.<br><sup>一良はそう前置きすると、一呼吸置いた。</sup><br><sup>Ichira made such a preface and took a breather.</sup></p>
<p id="L130"><br></p>
<p id="L131">"About the padlocked room in the mansion, I went into that room about six months ago.<br><sup>「屋敷の南京錠がかかってた部屋のことなんだけど、俺、半年くらい前にその部屋に入ったんだよ」</sup><br><sup>"It was the room where the padlock was locked in the house, and I said I, "I entered the room about half a year ago."</sup></p>
<p id="L132"><br></p>
<p id="L133">"......<br><sup>『……』</sup><br><sup>『……』</sup></p>
<p id="L134"><br></p>
<p id="L135">"And then, in an instant, the view in front of me switched to reveal a stone walkway. ...... Dad, are you listening?"<br><sup>「そしたらさ、一瞬で目の前の景色が切り替わって、石造りの通路が現れたんだ。……父さん、聞いてる？」</sup><br><sup>"Then, in an instant, the view in front of me changed, and a stone passage appeared....dad, are you listening?"</sup></p>
<p id="L136"><br></p>
<p id="L137">"...... Oh.<br><sup>『……ああ』</sup><br><sup>'...oh,'</sup></p>
<p id="L138"><br></p>
<p id="L139">"So I went to the end of the passage and found a thicket that I had never seen before. There was a village at the end of the thicket.<br><sup>「それでさ、その通路の先に行ってみたら、見たこともない雑木林が広がってたんだ。で、その雑木林を抜けた所に村があったんだよ」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I went down the aisle and found a thick forest I had never seen before.and there was a village through the thicket."</sup></p>
<p id="L140"><br></p>
<p id="L141">Shinji listened to Kazuyoshi's story in silence, not saying a word.<br><sup>一良の話を、真治は何も言わずに黙って聞いている。</sup><br><sup>Shinji listens to Ichira in silence without saying anything.</sup></p>
<p id="L142">The fact that he knows about the door to the other world is definite, considering the conversations I've had with him.<br><sup>彼が異世界へと通じる扉のことについて知っているということは、今までの彼との会話を考えれば確定的だ。</sup><br><sup>His knowledge of the door to a different world is conclusive given his conversations so far.</sup></p>
<p id="L143">The question was what and how much he knew, and why he hadn't told me anything about the door.<br><sup>問題は、彼が何をどこまで知っているかということと、どうして扉のことを何も教えてくれなかったのかということだ。</sup><br><sup>The question is what he knows and how far he knows, and why he didn't tell me anything about the door.</sup></p>
<p id="L144"><br></p>
<p id="L145">"The village was called Grisea, and it was in trouble because of a famine. I brought them some food and tools and helped them out. After that, I was allowed to live in the village for a while. After that, a lot of things happened, and now I'm helping the lord of a big city called Isteria with his mansion and internal affairs.<br><sup>「その村はグリセア村っていうんだけど、そこが飢饉で大変なことになっててさ。なりゆきでこっちから色々と食べ物やら道具やらを持っていって助けることになったんだ。それからしばらくの間、俺はその村に住まわせてもらってた。その後も色々あって、今はイステリアっていう大きな街の領主の屋敷で内政の手伝いをしてる」</sup><br><sup>"It's called the village of Glycer, which is in great trouble because of famine.I ended up taking a lot of food and tools with me to help.For a while after that, I was allowed to live in the village.Many things have happened since then, and now I'm helping with domestic affairs in the mansion of the lord of a large city called Isteria."</sup></p>
<p id="L146"><br></p>

<p id="L149">"Let me get this straight. You know about the door to the other side, right?<br><sup>「単刀直入に聞くけど、父さんはあっちの世界に通じてる扉のこと知ってるんだろ？」</sup><br><sup>"I'll ask you straightforwardly, but you know the door that leads to that world, don't you?"</sup></p>

<p id="L151">When Kazuyoshi asked him that, Shinji sighed deeply.<br><sup>一良がそう問いかけると、真治は深くため息をついた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira asked him so, Shinji sighed deeply.</sup></p>

<p id="L153">"Yeah, I know.<br><sup>『ああ、知ってるよ』</sup><br><sup>'Oh, I know,'</sup></p>
<p id="L154"><br></p>
<p id="L155">"...... So why didn't you tell me anything?　If you led me to come to this mansion, you must have wanted me to do something in the other world, right?"<br><sup>「……じゃあ、何で俺に何も教えてくれなかったわけ？　俺をこの屋敷に来るように誘導したってことは、俺にあっちの世界で何かやらせたいことがあったんだろ？」</sup><br><sup>"...then why didn't you tell me anything?"You induced me to come to this house, didn't you?"There was something you wanted me to do over there in the world?"</sup></p>
<p id="L156"><br></p>
<p id="L157">I know you have a lot of questions, but there's nothing I can tell you. Or rather, I can't teach you.<br><sup>『いろいろと聞きたいこともあるだろうが、俺からお前に教えられることは何もない。というか、教えるわけにはいかないんだよ』</sup><br><sup>'You may want to ask me a lot of questions, but I have nothing to teach you.I mean, I can't teach you.'</sup></p>

<p id="L159">I can't see the ...... story at all." What do you mean you can't tell me what to do?"<br><sup>「……話が全然見えてこないんだけど。教えるわけにはいかないってどういうことだよ」</sup><br><sup>"...I can't see anything at all about it'What do you mean I can't teach you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L160"><br></p>
<p id="L161">Unable to read the intent of the words, Kazuyoshi asked back.<br><sup>言葉の意図が読み取れず、一良は問い返す。</sup><br><sup>I couldn't read the meaning of the words, so Ichira asked back.</sup></p>
<p id="L162">If you say that you know something but can't tell me anything about it, I won't be able to convince you.<br><sup>知っているのに何も教えられないなどと言われても、納得がいくはずもない。</sup><br><sup>It's not convincing to be told that you know but can't teach anything.</sup></p>
<p id="L163"><br></p>
<p id="L164">'It's definitely not in your best interest for me to explain everything to you. Well, I can give you some advice.<br><sup>『俺がすべてを説明するのは、絶対にお前のためにならない。まあ、助言程度ならできるがな』</sup><br><sup>'It will never do you any good to explain everything to me.Well, I can do it just for advice.'</sup></p>

<p id="L166">"No, I don't know what you mean. ...... I mean, you could have at least told me about the food. You could have at least told us about food. We could have starved to death.<br><sup>「いや、言ってる意味がさっぱり……ていうか、食べ物のことくらい教えてくれてもよかっただろ。下手すりゃ餓死するところだったんだぞ」</sup><br><sup>"No, the meaning of what I'm saying is not at all... or rather, you could have told me about food.If you weren't good at it, you would have starved to death."</sup></p>
<p id="L167"><br></p>
<p id="L168">"...... Starving to death?　We can always come back, so we can at least get some food. If you can't afford it over there, you should have prepared plenty of it over here. I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.<br><sup>『……餓死？　いつでも戻ってこれるんだから、食料くらいなんとでもなるだろ。あっちで都合がつかなかったなら、こっちでたっぷり用意していけばよかっただろうが。それに、さっき食べ物やら道具やら持って行ったって言ってたじゃないか』</sup><br><sup>'...starve to death? You can always come back, so food will be everything.If it was not convenient for you, you should have prepared plenty here.Besides, you said you took food and tools with you earlier.'</sup></p>
<p id="L169"><br></p>
<p id="L170">"No, no, no, that's not what I meant. All I'm saying is ......"<br><sup>「いやいや、そういう意味じゃないんだって。俺が言いたいのは……」</sup><br><sup>"No, no, that's not what I meant.What I'm trying to say is...</sup></p>
<p id="L171"><br></p>
<p id="L172">"Ah, that's enough for now, listen to me.<br><sup>『あー、とりあえずそれはいいから、俺の話を聞け』</sup><br><sup>'Oh, that's all right for now, listen to me,'</sup></p>

<p id="L174">When he was told in a slightly stronger tone, Kazuyoshi closed his mouth.<br><sup>少し強い口調で言われ、一良は口を閉ざす。</sup><br><sup>Ichira closes his mouth when he is told in a slightly strong tone.</sup></p>
<p id="L175"><br></p>
<p id="L176">"I didn't tell you about the room in the mansion because I thought I should. I apologize for slinking away, pretending I didn't know anything about it. But I thought it was the best way to go about it. I wanted you to be in control of your own thoughts as much as possible. At the very least, it's not something a parent should mess with.<br><sup>『屋敷の部屋のことをお前に教えなかったのは、そうするべきだと俺は考えたからだ。何も知らないふりをしてすっとぼけてたことは謝る。だが、それが一番いい方法だと思ったんだよ。できる限り、お前自身の考えの元で行動して欲しかったんだ。少なくとも、親が手を出す話じゃない』</sup><br><sup>'I didn't tell you about the house because I thought I should.I apologize for pretending not to know anything.But I thought that was the best way.

<p id="L184">I don't know what kind of people you are involved with or what you are trying to do, but make sure you act in a way that will leave you with no regrets.

<p id="L196">Kazuyoshi was about to say this when he pulled the phone away from his ear.<br><sup>一良はそう言いかけて、携帯電話を耳から離した。</sup><br><sup>Ichira began to say so and took his cell-phone away from his ear.</sup></p>
