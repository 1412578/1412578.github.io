<p id="L1">Three days later in the morning, Baretta was accompanied by Isaac to the encampment of the garrison troops.<br><sup>３日後の朝、バレッタはアイザックに連れられて、駐屯部隊の野営地へとやってきていた。</sup><br><sup>Three mornings later, Valletta was led by Isaac to the camp of the garrison.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">Sylvestria smiled as she greeted Baretta.<br><sup>シルベストリアはバレッタを出迎えると、にっこりと微笑んだ。</sup><br><sup>Silvestria greeted Valletta and smiled.</sup></p>
<p id="L3"><br></p>
<p id="L4">"Hello. Isaac told me about you. He wants me to teach him martial arts?"<br><sup>「こんにちは。アイザックから話は聞いてるよ。武術を教えて欲しいんだって？」</sup><br><sup>"Hello, I've heard from Isaac.You want me to teach you martial arts?"</sup></p>
<p id="L5"><br></p>
<p id="L6">"Yes. I'll do my best, please."<br><sup>「はい。頑張りますので、よろしくお願いします」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I'll do my best, so please take care of me."</sup></p>
<p id="L7"><br></p>
<p id="L8">"Yes, I understand. If you work hard, the results will come back to you, so let's work hard."<br><sup>「うん、分かった。真面目にやれば結果は必ず返ってくるから、頑張ろうね」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, sir.If you take it seriously, you'll definitely get the results, so let's do our best."</sup></p>
<p id="L9"><br></p>
<p id="L10">"Yes, yes!"<br><sup>「は、はい！」</sup><br><sup>"Yes!"</sup></p>
<p id="L11"><br></p>
<p id="L12">Silvestria sent a nearby soldier to retrieve her training armor and turned to Isaac.<br><sup>シルベストリアは付近の兵士に訓練用の武具を取りに行かせると、アイザックに顔を向けた。</sup><br><sup>Silvestria sent a nearby soldier to get his training armour and turned to Isaac.</sup></p>
<p id="L13"><br></p>
<p id="L14">"'Well then, I've certainly taken this girl on. I just need to teach her to do one thing, right?"<br><sup>「それじゃ、この娘は確かに引き受けたよ。一通りできるように教えればいいんだっけ？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I'm sure this girl has taken it.Should I teach them so that they can do the whole thing?"</sup></p>
<p id="L15"><br></p>
<p id="L16">"Yes. I would like you to teach me everything a nobleman's child should learn, from swordsmanship to riding. As for riding, it is enough if you can master it to some extent.<br><sup>「はい。剣術から騎乗まで、貴族の子弟が習うことはすべてお願いします。騎乗については、ある程度乗りこなすことができるようになれば十分ですので」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, from swordsmanship to horseback riding, please do everything the aristocratic children learn.As for riding, it would be sufficient if I could ride it to some extent."</sup></p>
<p id="L17"><br></p>
<p id="L18">"Hmm, okay. It looks like we have some time, so let's take it easy."<br><sup>「ん、了解。時間はあるみたいだし、のんびりやろっか」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I understand. I think I have time, so let's relax."</sup></p>
<p id="L19"><br></p>
<p id="L20">"Yes, please."<br><sup>「はい、よろしくお願いします」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I look forward to your kind regards.</sup></p>
<p id="L21"><br></p>
<p id="L22">Silvestria smiled at her, and Baretta also smiled, a little less nervous.<br><sup>笑顔を向けるシルベストリアに、バレッタも少し緊張が解けて微笑んだ。</sup><br><sup>As Silvestria smiled, Valletta smiled a little relieved.</sup></p>
<p id="L23">Such a gentle response was surprising to Baretta, who had imagined him to be more strict.<br><sup>もっと厳しい人物を想像していたバレッタにとって、このような優しい対応は意外だった。</sup><br><sup>For Valletta, who had imagined a tougher person, such a gentle response was unexpected.</sup></p>
<p id="L24">But on the other hand, it could be taken as a stance that everything depends on Baretta's motivation.<br><sup>だが裏を返せば、すべてはバレッタのやる気次第というスタンスとも受け取れる。</sup><br><sup>On the contrary, however, it can be interpreted as a stance that everything depends on Valletta's motivation.</sup></p>
<p id="L25">It is very dangerous to relax into a lax response.<br><sup>甘い対応に気を緩めるのは非常に危険だ。</sup><br><sup>It is very dangerous to relax your attention to lenient responses.</sup></p>
<p id="L26"><br></p>
<p id="L27">"Let's get started.<br><sup>「早速始めよっか」</sup><br><sup>"Shall we start at once?"</sup></p>
<p id="L28"><br></p>
<p id="L29">Silvestria took the wooden sword that the soldier had brought and threw it to Baretta.<br><sup>シルベストリアは兵士が持ってきた木剣を受け取ると、バレッタに投げた。</sup><br><sup>Silvestria took the wooden sword brought by the soldiers and threw it at Valletta.</sup></p>
<p id="L30">Baretta takes it with one hand and looks a little annoyed.<br><sup>バレッタは片手でそれを受け取り、少し困ったような顔をする。</sup><br><sup>Valletta takes it with one hand and looks a little troubled.</sup></p>
<p id="L31"><br></p>
<p id="L32">"Let's see, ......."<br><sup>「えっと……」</sup><br><sup>"Well..."</sup></p>
<p id="L33"><br></p>
<p id="L34">"What?　What's wrong?"<br><sup>「ん？　どうかした？」</sup><br><sup>"Huh? What's the matter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L35"><br></p>
<p id="L36">"I'd like to change my location if possible. ......"<br><sup>「できれば場所を変えたいのですが……」</sup><br><sup>"If possible, I'd like to change places..."</sup></p>
<p id="L37"><br></p>
<p id="L38">"Yeah?　Then let's move it. Where do you want to do it?"<br><sup>「そう？　なら、場所を移そっか。どこでやる？」</sup><br><sup>"Really? Then let's move to another place.Where shall we do it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">"I prefer the forest on the outskirts of the village. That's where I always practice."<br><sup>「村はずれの森の中がいいです。いつもそこで練習しているので」</sup><br><sup>"I like the forest on the outskirts of the village.I always practice there."</sup></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42">"All right. Isaac, I'll take care of the rest, you can go now."<br><sup>「りょーかい。アイザック、後は私がやるから、もう行っていいよ」</sup><br><sup>"Well, Isaac, I'll take care of the rest, so you can go now."</sup></p>
<p id="L43"><br></p>
<p id="L44">"Very well, sir. I look forward to working with you."<br><sup>「かしこまりました。よろしくお願いします」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, sir.Thank you for your cooperation."</sup></p>
<p id="L45"><br></p>
<p id="L46">The two of them left Isaac where he was and headed for the forest.<br><sup>２人はアイザックをその場に残し、森へと足を向けた。</sup><br><sup>They left Isaac there and turned to the forest.</sup></p>
<p id="L47"><br></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49"><br></p>
<p id="L50">"Okay, let's get started."<br><sup>「よし、始めよう」</sup><br><sup>"All right, let's get started,"</sup></p>
<p id="L51"><br></p>
<p id="L52">When they reached the forest, Silvestria readied her sword.<br><sup>森に着くと、シルベストリアは剣を構えた。</sup><br><sup>When Silvestria reached the forest, she held her sword.</sup></p>
<p id="L53">Make a clenched fist with your left hand and place it behind your waist, holding it tightly against your hip.<br><sup>左手は握りこぶしを作って腰の後ろに回し、腰に密着させて固定する。</sup><br><sup>Make a fist with your left hand and rotate it back to your waist and fix it close to your waist.</sup></p>
<p id="L54">The sword in his right hand is in a middle stance with the tip of the sword pointing at the opponent's face and the right half of his body in front of him.<br><sup>右手に持つ剣は剣先を相手の顔に向け、右半身を前にした中段の構えだ。</sup><br><sup>The sword in his right hand is a middle-stage position with the tip of the sword facing the opponent's face and the right half facing forward.</sup></p>
<p id="L55">The wooden sword was the same one Baretta always used, with a blade length of about 60 centimeters.<br><sup>木剣はいつもバレッタが使っているものと同じ、刃渡りが60センチ程度のものである。</sup><br><sup>The wooden sword is the same as the one Valletta always uses, and the blade is about 60 centimeters long.</sup></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">"I'm going to attack, can you try to take it well?　You've learned the form, right?"<br><sup>「私が攻撃するから、上手く受けてみてくれる？　形は習ってるよね？」</sup><br><sup>"I'll attack you, so can you take it well?"You're learning the shape, right?"</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">"Yes, in case you're wondering, ...... my practice with Isaac was mostly with shields, but don't you use shields?"<br><sup>「はい、一応は……アイザックさんとの練習では盾を使ったものが主だったのですが、盾は使わないのですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, just in case... I mainly practiced with Isaac using shields, but don't you use shields?"</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">Silvestria nodded to Baretta as she held up her sword.<br><sup>剣を構えながら言うバレッタに、シルベストリアが頷く。</sup><br><sup>Silvestria nods to Valletta, who holds her sword.</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63">"There are times when you can't use your shield, you know. In fact, I think there are more times when you can't use it.　I'm sure there are more times like that than usual, so let's prioritize this one."<br><sup>「盾が使えない時だってあるからね。むしろ、使えない時のほうが多いんじゃないかな？　普段はそういうときのほうが多いだろうし、こっちを優先しよう」</sup><br><sup>"There are times when you can't use a shield. Rather, I think there are more times when you can't use it.Usually, there are more times like that, so let's give priority to this."</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">"Okay, I get it."<br><sup>「わ、分かりました」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, I see,"</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">"Okay. Let's get started."<br><sup>「よし。始めるよ」</sup><br><sup>"All right, let's get started."</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">After saying no, Silvestria gave Baretta a medium thrust.<br><sup>そう断りを入れると、シルベストリアはバレッタに中段の突きを入れた。</sup><br><sup>When Silvestria refused, she thrust a middle thrust into Valletta.</sup></p>
<p id="L70">It's not that fast, it's a slow thrust that is supposed to be caught.<br><sup>それほど速いものではなく、受け止められること前提のスローな突きだ。</sup><br><sup>It's not that fast, it's a slow thrust on the premise that it's acceptable.</sup></p>
<p id="L71">Baretta caught the movement of the sword and caught it with her belly, just as she had learned from Isaac.<br><sup>バレッタはしっかりと剣の動きをとらえ、アイザックに習っていたとおりに剣の腹でいなすように受け止めた。</sup><br><sup>Valletta grasped the movement of the sword, and, as he had learned from Isaac, took it with his belly.</sup></p>
<p id="L72">Twist and pass it off as if you were paying it off.<br><sup>捻りを加え、払うように受け流す。</sup><br><sup>Twist it and let it go as if it were paying.</sup></p>
<p id="L73"><br></p>
<p id="L74">"I'll move my legs."<br><sup>「足も動かすよ」</sup><br><sup>"I'll move my legs,"</sup></p>
<p id="L75"><br></p>
<p id="L76">Sylvestria walked a little to the side and looked straight at Baretta.<br><sup>シルベストリアは少しずつ横に歩きながら、真っ直ぐにバレッタを見据える。</sup><br><sup>Silvestria walks sideways little by little and looks straight at Valletta.</sup></p>
<p id="L77">Barletta followed suit, moving her foot to the right in time.<br><sup>バレッタもそれに合わせ、間合いを取りながら右方向に足を動かした。</sup><br><sup>Valletta moved her feet to the right at intervals.</sup></p>
<p id="L78">The two move slowly in a circular motion, with the sword tip at the center.<br><sup>２人は剣先を中心にして、円を描くようにゆっくりと動く。</sup><br><sup>They move slowly around the tip of their swords in a circle.</sup></p>
<p id="L79"><br></p>
<p id="L80">"I'm going to make it a little faster so you can take it all in."<br><sup>「少しずつ速くするから、全部受け止めてね」</sup><br><sup>"I'll make it faster little by little, so please accept everything."</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">"Yes."<br><sup>「はい」</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">Just as before, Silvestria delivers a mid-level thrust.<br><sup>先ほどと同様に、シルベストリアが中段の突きを繰り出す。</sup><br><sup>As before, the silvestria projects the middle stage.</sup></p>
<p id="L85">When Baretta catches it, she immediately draws her sword and does an upper-level kesa-slash.<br><sup>バレッタが受け止めると、直ぐに剣を引いて上段の袈裟斬り。</sup><br><sup>As soon as Valletta accepted it, he drew his sword and cut it on the top.</sup></p>
<p id="L86">This is another slow attack.<br><sup>これもスローな攻撃だ。</sup><br><sup>This is also a slow attack.</sup></p>
<p id="L87"><br></p>
<p id="L88">"I'll go in succession.<br><sup>「連続でいくよ」</sup><br><sup>"I'll go in a row,"</sup></p>
<p id="L89"><br></p>
<p id="L90">Baretta catches all of the slow attacks that are rhythmically added to her upper, middle, and lower levels.<br><sup>上段、中段、下段とリズミカルに加えられるスローな攻撃を、バレッタはすべて受け止める。</sup><br><sup>Valletta accepts all slow attacks made in the upper, middle, lower and rhythmic directions.</sup></p>
<p id="L91">As Baretta was taking in the alternating slashes and thrusts, Silvestria let out a whispered, "Oh.<br><sup>斬撃、突きと交互に繰り出されるそれをバレッタが受け止めていると、シルベストリアは小声で「おお」と漏らした。</sup><br><sup>Silvestria whispered, "Oh," as Valletta accepted it alternately delivered by slashing and thrusting.</sup></p>
<p id="L92">With each strike, the attack speed will gradually increase.<br><sup>一撃を重ねるごと、少しずつ攻撃速度が速まってくる。</sup><br><sup>With each blow, the attack speed increases little by little by little.</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94">"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve.<br><sup>「いち、に、いち、に……ほら、ちゃんと足も動かして」</sup><br><sup>"One, two, one, two... you know, move your legs properly."</sup></p>
<p id="L95"><br></p>
<p id="L96">"Yes, yes!"<br><sup>「は、はいっ！」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, yes!"</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">The space between the clashing of the wooden swords gradually narrowed as Silvestria's voice spoke.<br><sup>がんがんと木剣同士のぶつかる音の間隔が、シルベストリアの声に合わせて徐々に狭まる。</sup><br><sup>The interval between the clashes of wooden swords and Silvestria's voice gradually narrows.</sup></p>
<p id="L99">Eventually she fell silent, and the order of her attacks became erratic.<br><sup>やがて彼女は無言になり、攻撃の順番も不規則になった。</sup><br><sup>Eventually she became silent and the order of attack became irregular.</sup></p>
<p id="L100">Baretta desperately moved her hands and feet to ward off her attack.<br><sup>バレッタは必死に手と足を動かし、彼女の攻撃を受け流す。</sup><br><sup>Valletta desperately moves her hands and feet to ward off her attack.</sup></p>
<p id="L101">Gradually, however, his movements became more and more erratic, and his inability to accept the situation became more and more noticeable.<br><sup>だが次第に動きに乱れが生じ、受け止めきれていないものが目立ってきた。</sup><br><sup>Gradually, however, there was confusion in the movement, and what was not fully understood became conspicuous.</sup></p>
<p id="L102">The tip of the sword, which slid in faster than Baretta could take it, was thrust at its throat.<br><sup>バレッタが受けるよりも速く滑り込んだ剣先が、その喉元に突きつけられる。</sup><br><sup>The tip of the sword slides faster than Valletta receives is pointed to his throat.</sup></p>
<p id="L103"><br></p>
<p id="L104">"Here we go. Well done."<br><sup>「ほい、ここまで。よくできました」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's it.Well done."</sup></p>
<p id="L105"><br></p>
<p id="L106">Quickly drawing her sword, Silvestria smiled.<br><sup>すっと剣を引き、シルベストリアは笑顔を見せた。</sup><br><sup>Silvestria smiled as she drew her sword.</sup></p>
<p id="L107">Baretta's mouth was dry and her breath was coming in gasps, though her body was not tired from the strain.<br><sup>バレッタは緊張からか、身体は疲れていないのに口の中がからからに乾き、息が上がってしまっている。</sup><br><sup>Perhaps because she is nervous, Valletta is not tired, but her mouth is dry and she is out of breath.</sup></p>
<p id="L108"><br></p>
<p id="L109">"You're amazing. From what I've heard, you've had very little time to learn.<br><sup>「きみ、すごいね。聞いた話だと指導してもらう時間なんてほとんどなかったはずなんだけど」</sup><br><sup>"You're amazing.I heard that I hardly had time to get guidance."</sup></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111">"Oh, thank you."<br><sup>「あ、ありがとうございます」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, thank you very much,"</sup></p>
<p id="L112"><br></p>
<p id="L113">"And you're a lot stronger than you look. If we were to collide, I'm afraid I'd be overpowered.<br><sup>「それに、見た目と違ってずいぶん力があるんだね。まともにぶつかったら私が押し負けちゃいそうだよ」</sup><br><sup>"And you have a lot of strength, unlike what you look like.I think I'll beat you if you hit me head on."</sup></p>
<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115">"Uh, let's see, ......."<br><sup>「え、えっと……」</sup><br><sup>"Well..."</sup></p>
<p id="L116"><br></p>
<p id="L117">Realizing that she had been too forceful, Valletta stammered.<br><sup>つい力が入ってしまっていたことに気づき、バレッタは口ごもった。</sup><br><sup>Valletta faltered when she realized that she had lost her strength.</sup></p>
<p id="L118">Silvestria didn't seem particularly concerned and nodded her head, saying, "Good.<br><sup>シルベストリアは特に気にする様子もなく、よし、と頷く。</sup><br><sup>Silvestria nods yes without showing any particular concern.</sup></p>
<p id="L119"><br></p>
<p id="L120">"Since you seem to be okay with the basics of ukemi, you can go ahead and hit me next. There's no need to rush, so let's take our time.<br><sup>「受けの基本は大丈夫みたいだから、次はきみが打ち込んできて。焦らなくていいから、じっくりやっていこう」</sup><br><sup>"The basics of reception seem to be all right, so you can type in next time.You don't have to hurry, so let's take our time."</sup></p>
<p id="L121"><br></p>
<p id="L122">"Yes!"<br><sup>「はい！」</sup><br><sup>"Yes!"</sup></p>
<p id="L123"><br></p>
<p id="L124">Silvestria smiled at Baretta, who replied cheerfully.<br><sup>元気よく返事をするバレッタに、シルベストリアは微笑んだ。</sup><br><sup>Silvestria smiled at Valletta, who replied cheerfully.</sup></p>
<p id="L125"><br></p>
<p id="L126"><br></p>
<p id="L127"><br></p>
<p id="L128">About the time Baretta was training.<br><sup>バレッタが訓練に励んでいる頃。</sup><br><sup>When Valletta was training hard.</sup></p>
<p id="L129">Kazuyoshi and Lise were walking side by side in the city near the center of Isteria.<br><sup>イステリアの中心部に近い街なかを、一良とリーゼは並んで歩いていた。</sup><br><sup>Ichira and Liese were walking side by side in the city near the center of the Easter.</sup></p>
<p id="L130">Today, Liese was not in armor, but in her normal dress.<br><sup>今日のリーゼは鎧姿ではなく、普段着のドレス姿である。</sup><br><sup>Today's Liese is not dressed in armor, but in everyday dress.</sup></p>
<p id="L131"><br></p>
<p id="L132">At the urging of Narson and Zirconia, they both decided to take the day off.<br><sup>ナルソンやジルコニアからの強い勧めで、今日は２人とも休みを取ることにしたのだ。</sup><br><sup>On the strong recommendation of Narson and Zirconia, they both decided to take a day off today.</sup></p>
<p id="L133">So, Liese invited Ichiran to go on an outing to the city, which she had promised to do for a long time, and here we are.<br><sup>そこで、かねてより約束していた街へのおでかけをしようとリーゼが一良を誘い、今に至る。</sup><br><sup>So Liese invited Ichira to go out to the city she had promised for a long time, and she still has.</sup></p>
<p id="L134"><br></p>
<p id="L135">The river construction is also closed today, and the artisans and servants are all taking the day off.<br><sup>河川工事も本日は休みとなっており、職人たちや使用人たちにも一斉に休みを取らせている。</sup><br><sup>The river works are closed today, and craftsmen and servants are also allowed to take a day off.</sup></p>
<p id="L136">Eira and Marie were also ordered to take the day off and should be enjoying their vacation.<br><sup>エイラとマリーにも休みが命じられ、それぞれ休暇を楽しんでいるはずだ。</sup><br><sup>Ayla and Marie have also been ordered to take a day off, and they must be enjoying their vacation.</sup></p>
<p id="L137">Incidentally, it was Lise who ordered the two to take a break.<br><sup>ちなみに、２人に休みを命じたのはリーゼである。</sup><br><sup>By the way, it was Liese who ordered them to rest.</sup></p>
<p id="L138"><br></p>
<p id="L139">"This place is really good. Eila and I often come here for lunch."<br><sup>「ここのお店がすごく美味しいんだ。よくエイラと２人でお昼を食べにくるの」</sup><br><sup>"The restaurant here is very delicious.I often come to lunch with Ayla."</sup></p>
<p id="L140"><br></p>
<p id="L141">Lise stopped in front of a small, wooden building.<br><sup>木造のこじんまりとした建物の前で、リーゼは足を止めた。</sup><br><sup>Liese stopped in front of a small wooden building.</sup></p>
<p id="L142"><br></p>
<p id="L143">At the entrance, there is a stone tablet on which today's recommended menu is written in stone handwriting along with the prices.<br><sup>入口には石版が置かれており、本日のおすすめメニューが値段とともに石筆で書き連ねられている。</sup><br><sup>There is a stone tablet at the entrance, and today's recommended menu is written with a stone brush along with the price.</sup></p>
<p id="L144">Food prices used to be high, but now they seem to be coming down a lot.<br><sup>以前は食料価格が高騰していたが、今はだいぶ価格が下がってきているようだ。</sup><br><sup>Food prices used to soar, but now they seem to be going down a lot.</sup></p>
<p id="L145">This was due to the release of food reserves by the lords for rationing and market intervention, as well as the increased yield in the granary and the sense of security spread by the introduction of water mills.<br><sup>領主側が備蓄食糧を放出して配給および市場介入をしたことと、穀倉地帯の収穫量増加や水車の導入によって広がった安心感が影響している。</sup><br><sup>The landlord's release of food reserves, distribution and market intervention, as well as the increase in crop yields and the introduction of watermills, have affected the situation.</sup></p>
<p id="L146">In response, the wealthy who had been hoarding food rushed to sell their stockpiles of food, which may have spurred the price decline.<br><sup>それらを受けて食料買占めをしていた富裕層が慌てて備蓄食料の売却に走ったことも、価格低下に拍車をかけたのだろう。</sup><br><sup>As a result, the wealthy, who had been hoarding food, rushed to sell their stockpiles, which may have accelerated the price decline.</sup></p>
<p id="L147"><br></p>
<p id="L148">"Oh, what a fancy place."<br><sup>「おー、お洒落な店だな」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that's a fashionable shop,"</sup></p>
<p id="L149"><br></p>
<p id="L150">I peeked inside from the entrance and saw that there seemed to be hardly any customers in the neat little store.<br><sup>入り口から中を覗いてみると、小奇麗な店内にはほとんど客がいないようだった。</sup><br><sup>I looked inside through the entrance and found that there were few customers in the neat shop.</sup></p>
<p id="L151">We came here very early because we heard that it was too crowded to get in at noon, but it seemed to have worked.<br><sup>お昼になると混んでいて入れないということでかなり早めに来たのだが、それが功を奏したようだ。</sup><br><sup>I came here quite early because it was crowded at noon, but it seems to have worked.</sup></p>

<p id="L155">As she said this, Lise teased her own arm around Ichiran's arm.<br><sup>そう言うと、リーゼは一良の腕に自らの腕をからめた。</sup><br><sup>Then Liese wrapped her arms around Ichira's.</sup></p>
<p id="L156">The sudden action made Kazuyoshi look at him with surprise.<br><sup>突然の行為に、一良はぎょっとして目を向ける。</sup><br><sup>Ichira looks at the sudden act.</sup></p>

<p id="L158">"Wait, why do you have your arms crossed?"<br><sup>「ちょ、何で腕を組むんだよ」</sup><br><sup>"Why do you fold your arms?"</sup></p>
<p id="L159"><br></p>
<p id="L160">As Ichiran tried to pull his arm back, Lise looked up at him with a worried expression.<br><sup>一良が腕を引っ込めようとすると、リーゼが不安げな表情で見上げてきた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira tried to withdraw his arm, Liese looked up anxiously.</sup></p>

<p id="L169">Lise immediately smiled and went straight into the store.<br><sup>リーゼはすぐに笑顔になり、そのまま店に入った。</sup><br><sup>Liese smiled at once and went straight into the shop.</sup></p>

<p id="L172"><br></p>
<p id="L173">As they entered the store, the woman who had been taking bread out of the stone oven behind the counter exclaimed in surprise.<br><sup>２人が店に入ると、カウンター裏の石釜からパンを取り出していた女が驚きの声を上げた。</sup><br><sup>When they entered the shop, a woman who was taking bread out of a stone pot behind the counter shouted in surprise.</sup></p>

<p id="L179">"No, sir.<br><sup>「違います」</sup><br><sup>"No,"</sup></p>

<p id="L206">Whenever we ate at the mansion, Lise always drank fruit wine at mealtime.<br><sup>屋敷での食事の際、リーゼは必ずといっていいほど食事時には果実酒を飲んでいた。</sup><br><sup>When Liese ate at the mansion, she almost always drank fruit wine.</sup></p>
<p id="L207">It is diluted with water to make it easier to drink, but it is definitely alcohol, and if you drink it, you will get drunk.<br><sup>飲みやすくするために水で薄められているのだが、アルコールには違いないので飲めば酔うはずだ。</sup><br><sup>It is diluted with water to make it easier to drink, but it must be alcohol, so you should get drunk if you drink it.</sup></p>

<p id="L251"><br></p>
<p id="L252">As I walked through the upscale commercial district, accompanied by Lise, who said there was a store she wanted to visit, I found a vendor selling salt from a simple stall on a cart.<br><sup>行きたい店があるというリーゼに連れられて高級商業区画を歩いていると、行商人が荷馬車の簡易露店で塩を売っているのを見つけた。</sup><br><sup>While walking along the high-end commercial block with Liese, who said she wanted to go to a store, she found a peddler selling salt at a cart stall.</sup></p>
<p id="L253">There are two kinds of salt for sale: pure white salt on a plate and gray salt in a jar.<br><sup>皿に盛られた純白の塩と、壷に入れられた灰色の塩の２種類が売られている。</sup><br><sup>Two kinds of salt are sold: pure white salt on a plate and gray salt in a jar.</sup></p>
<p id="L254">In front of the pure white salt was a wooden board with the word "yakishio" written on it.<br><sup>純白の塩の前には『<ruby><rb>焼塩</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>やきしお</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>』と書かれた木板が立てかけられていた。</sup><br><sup>In front of the pure white salt was a wooden board with the words "yakishio" written on it.</sup></p>
<p id="L255">It is much more expensive than gray salt.<br><sup>灰色の塩と比べて、かなり値段が高い。</sup><br><sup>Compared to gray salt, it is quite expensive.</sup></p>
<p id="L256"><br></p>
<p id="L257">"That's Freisian salt. The baked salt is more expensive than the Gregorian salt, but the other salt is a little cheaper. But the quality is not as good.<br><sup>「あれはフライス領の塩だね。焼塩はグレゴルン領のものより高いけど、その他の塩は少し安いよ。その分、質は悪いけど」</sup><br><sup>"That's the salt of the milling, isn't it?"Grilled salt is more expensive than Gregorne's, but other salts are a little cheaper.That's why the quality is bad."</sup></p>
<p id="L258"><br></p>
<p id="L259">Lise whispered as she left the scene after a quick look around.<br><sup>軽く見物してからその場を離れると、リーゼが小声でそう言った。</sup><br><sup>I took a quick look at it and left, and Liese whispered,</sup></p>
<p id="L260"><br></p>
<p id="L261">"Heh, ...... burnt salt is salt that's been cooked once to prevent it from dissolving in moisture?"<br><sup>「へえ……焼塩って、湿気で溶けないように一度火を通した塩だっけ？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh... was baked salt cooked once so that it wouldn't melt in moisture?"</sup></p>
<p id="L262"><br></p>
<p id="L263">"Yes, yes."<br><sup>「そうそう」</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L264"><br></p>
<p id="L265">Salt that has not been cooked will absorb moisture from the air and become sticky over time.<br><sup>火を通していない塩は空気中の湿気を吸収してしまい、時間が経つとべちゃべちゃになってしまう。</sup><br><sup>Uncooked salt absorbs moisture from the air and becomes sticky over time.</sup></p>
<p id="L266">The water that comes out of the dissolved salt is called "bittern" and has been used in Japan since ancient times to harden tofu.<br><sup>溶けた塩から出た水は『にがり』と呼ばれ、古来より日本では豆腐を固める際に用いられていた。</sup><br><sup>Water from melted salt is called "nigari" and has been used since ancient times in Japan to harden tofu.</sup></p>
<p id="L267">In order to prevent the salt from dissolving, it is stored in a jar called a "salt jar", shut off from the outside air, but even so, it is inevitable that it will become damp.<br><sup>塩が溶けるのを防ぐために塩壷という壷に入れて外気と遮断して保管されるのだが、それでも湿気てしまうことは避けられない。</sup><br><sup>To prevent salt from dissolving, it is kept in a jar called a salt jar, but it is still inevitable that it will become damp.</sup></p>
<p id="L268">Therefore, a method was devised to make the salt last longer by frying it with a roasting pan (a flat unglazed earthenware pot) to completely remove the water.<br><sup>そこで、<ruby><rb>焙烙</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>ほうろく</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>（平たい素焼きの土鍋）などを使って塩を炒り、水分を完全に飛ばしてしまうことで長持ちさせるという手法が考え出された。</sup><br><sup>Therefore, a method of making salt last longer by frying it with roasting (flat unglazed earthen pot) and completely dissipating water.</sup></p>
<p id="L269">At that time, it was discovered that cooking salt changed its properties and almost eliminated its hygroscopicity, which led to the popularization of burnt salt.<br><sup>その時に、火を通すことで塩の性質が変わって吸湿性がほとんどなくなるということが発見され、一般化したものが焼塩である。</sup><br><sup>At that time, it was discovered that the properties of salt changed and hygroscopicity disappeared by cooking, and the generalized salt was calcined salt.</sup></p>
<p id="L270"><br></p>
<p id="L271">Incidentally, common salt sold in Japan is called refined salt, and there is no need to fry it to worry about its hygroscopicity.<br><sup>ちなみに、日本で売られている一般的な食塩は精製塩と呼ばれるものであり、吸湿性を心配して炒る必要はない。</sup><br><sup>By the way, the common salt sold in Japan is called refined salt, so you don't have to worry about hygroscopicity and fry it.</sup></p>
<p id="L272"><br></p>
<p id="L273">"Since Gregorian salt was discounted by two, the merchants in Freis have been competing to lower their prices. However, the quality of the salt is obviously not as good as that of Gregorian salt, so even though the price is lower, it's not very popular.<br><sup>「グレゴルン領の塩が２割引になってからは、フライス領の商人も競争して値段を下げてきたんだ。ただ、明らかにグレゴルン領の塩に比べて質が悪いから、値段が安くてもあんまり人気はないんだけどね」</sup><br><sup>"After the 20% discount on the salt in Gregorne, the merchants in the Milling Territory have been competing to lower their prices.But it's obviously inferior to Gregorian salt, so even if it's cheap, it's not very popular."</sup></p>
<p id="L274"><br></p>
<p id="L275">"What exactly is bad quality, and how is it bad?"<br><sup>「質が悪いって、具体的にどういうふうに悪いんだ？」</sup><br><sup>"How exactly is poor quality bad?"</sup></p>
<p id="L276"><br></p>
<p id="L277">"If it's a bad one, there's a lot of sand and garbage mixed in. I think it's because they're making it too messy to handle the volume."<br><sup>「酷いのだと砂とかゴミが思いっきり混じってるよ。量をこなすために雑に作ってるからだと思うけど」</sup><br><sup>"If it's terrible, there's a lot of sand and garbage mixed in it.I think it's because I make it roughly to make the amount."</sup></p>
<p id="L278"><br></p>
<p id="L279">"That's not going to be popular. ...... Don't the ones in Gregorian territory have that?"<br><sup>「そりゃ人気でないわ……グレゴルン領のものはそういうのはないのか？」</sup><br><sup>"That's not popular... isn't there anything like that in Gregorne?"</sup></p>
<p id="L280"><br></p>
<p id="L281">"Yes. Even though it's colored, there's not a lot of garbage mixed in. It tastes good, too."<br><sup>「うん。色は付いててもゴミとか混じってるのはあんまりないね。味もおいしいよ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes. Even if it's colored, there's not much trash mixed in.It tastes good, too."</sup></p>

<p id="L318">She looked up at Kazuyoshi standing next to her and smiled happily.<br><sup>隣に立つ一良を見上げ、楽しそうに微笑む。</sup><br><sup>He looks up at Ichira standing next to him and smiles happily.</sup></p>
<p id="L319"><br></p>
<p id="L320">"I think you're overreacting."<br><sup>「その表現はいくらなんでも大げさだろ」</sup><br><sup>"That expression is exaggerated, isn't it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L321"><br></p>
<p id="L322">"No, it's not. This is the first time I've gone out alone with a man like this."<br><sup>「そんなことないよ。こうやって男の人と２人だけで出かけるの、初めてだもん」</sup><br><sup>"That's not the case.I've never been out with a man like this before."</sup></p>

<p id="L327"><br></p>
<p id="L328">"Yeah, it's a status thing. ...... No one's wearing it today, is that okay?"<br><sup>「ああ、身分的にそうだよな……今日は誰も付けてないけど、いいのか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that's true in terms of status... no one's wearing it today, is that okay?"</sup></p>
<p id="L329"><br></p>
<p id="L330">When Kazuyoshi said that, Lise looked back at the entrance of the store.<br><sup>一良がそう言うと、リーゼは店の入口を振り返った。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira said so, Liese looked back at the entrance of the store.</sup></p>
<p id="L331">From a distance, I could see people passing by on the street.<br><sup>遠目に、道を行き交う人びとの姿が見える。</sup><br><sup>From a distance, you can see people walking up and down the street.</sup></p>
<p id="L332"><br></p>
<p id="L333">"I think there's probably a plainclothes guard around."<br><sup>「たぶん、あの辺に私服の護衛兵がいると思うよ」</sup><br><sup>"Perhaps there's a plain-clothes bodyguard around there,"</sup></p>

<p id="L336">However, there must be a plainclothes soldier somewhere in there, like the one who appeared when I bumped into Lise in Isteria before.<br><sup>だが、以前イステリアでリーゼとぶつかった時に現れたような私服の兵士が、どこかにまぎれているのだろう。</sup><br><sup>But there must be some plainclothes soldier who appeared before when he bumped into Liese in the Easter.</sup></p>

<p id="L338">"I'd really like to go out and not have to worry about anyone's eyes on me, but I don't have a choice."<br><sup>「本当は誰の目も気にしないで出かけてみたいけど、仕方ないよね」</sup><br><sup>"I really want to go out without worrying about anyone's eyes, but I can't help it."</sup></p>

<p id="L351">When Kazuyoshi said that, Lise's expression lit up.<br><sup>一良がそう言うと、リーゼの表情がぱっと輝いた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira said that, Liese's expression suddenly shone.</sup></p>
<p id="L352"><br></p>
<p id="L353">"What, are you sure?"<br><sup>「えっ、いいの！？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that's all right!"</sup></p>
<p id="L354"><br></p>
<p id="L355">"Sure. If there's anything else you want, let me know. Your brother will buy it for you. Don't be shy."<br><sup>「おうよ。他にも何か欲しいものがあったら言いなさい。お兄さんが買ってあげよう。遠慮しなくていいぞ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, tell me if you want anything else.I'll buy it for you.You don't have to hesitate."</sup></p>
