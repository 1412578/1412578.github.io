<p id="L1">The morning after three days.<br><sup>３日後の朝。</sup><br><sup>Three days later, in the morning.</sup></p>
<p id="L2"><br></p>
<p id="L3">After breakfast, Kazuyoshi had been taken by Lise to a military facility in the city of Isteria.<br><sup>朝食を終えた一良は、リーゼに連れられてイステリアの街中にある軍事施設にやってきていた。</sup><br><sup>After breakfast, Ichira was taken to a military facility in the city of Isteria by Liese.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">This military facility is surrounded by a three-meter high stone wall that prevents people from peeking in from the outside.<br><sup>この軍事施設は周囲を３メートルほどの高さの石壁で囲われており、外からはのぞき見ることができないようになっている。</sup><br><sup>The military facility is surrounded by stone walls about three meters high and cannot be seen from the outside.</sup></p>
<p id="L5">Soldiers and servants in armor can be seen here and there throughout the grounds.<br><sup>敷地内のあちこちには、鎧姿の兵士や使用人たちの姿が見られる。</sup><br><sup>Soldiers and servants in armor can be seen everywhere on the premises.</sup></p>
<p id="L6">When they saw Liese, they all straightened their postures and folded their hips to greet her.<br><sup>彼らはリーゼの姿を見ると一様に姿勢を正し、腰を折って挨拶をした。</sup><br><sup>When they saw Liese, they straightened up and bowed.</sup></p>
<p id="L7"><br></p>
<p id="L8">All the soldiers except the Kingsguard are training in this facility. There should be training going on in the square at this time, so let's go there."<br><sup>「近衛兵以外の兵たちは、全員がこの施設で訓練を行っています。今の時間なら広場で訓練が行われているはずですから、行ってみましょう」</sup><br><sup>"All but the Guards are training at this facility.At this time, training should be taking place in the square, so let's go."</sup></p>
<p id="L9"><br></p>
<p id="L10">Liese responded to them with a smile and moved around the grounds with Kazuyoshi.<br><sup>リーゼは彼らに笑顔で応えながら、一良を伴って敷地内を移動する。</sup><br><sup>Liese responds to them with a smile and moves around the property with Ichira.</sup></p>
<p id="L11">As usual, Liese was in her armor, but her hair was still long as usual, not in a chignon.<br><sup>例のごとくリーゼは鎧姿だが、今日の髪型はシニヨンではなく普段と同じロングのままだ。</sup><br><sup>As usual, Liese is wearing armor, but today's hairstyle is not Shinyoung, but long as usual.</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">I understand. But still, this is a very big facility. ......"<br><sup>「わかりました。それにしても、ここはずいぶんと大きな施設なんですね……」</sup><br><sup>"All right.Even so, this is a very large institution..."</sup></p>
<p id="L14"><br></p>
<p id="L15">Kazuyoshi had seen the overview from outside the facility earlier, and the endless stone walls seemed to be quite long.<br><sup>一良は先ほど施設の外から概観を見たのだが、延々と伸びる石壁はかなりの長さがあるように見えた。</sup><br><sup>Ichira just looked at the overview from outside the facility, and the stone wall that stretched out endlessly looked quite long.</sup></p>
<p id="L16">Having such a huge military facility in the middle of the city seems to be very disturbing from a traffic point of view.<br><sup>街中にこれほど巨大な軍事施設があっては、交通の観点から見ると非常に邪魔なように思える。</sup><br><sup>It seems very disturbing from a traffic point of view to have such a huge military facility in the city.</sup></p>
<p id="L17">However, for the soldiers staying in the city, it is a good location where they can go out into the city at any time, so considering their living environment, this arrangement may be acceptable.<br><sup>だが、滞在する兵士たちにとってはいつでも街に繰り出せる好立地なので、彼らの生活環境を考えればこの配置もありなのだろう。</sup><br><sup>However, it is a good location for the soldiers staying in the city at any time, so this arrangement may be appropriate considering their living conditions.</sup></p>
<p id="L18">The perimeter of the facility was lined with numerous stores, including small restaurants and clothing stores, probably catering to the soldiers who were staying there.<br><sup>滞在する兵士たちを目当てにしているのか、施設の外周には小料理屋や衣料品店など、数多くの店が軒を連ねていた。</sup><br><sup>There were many restaurants and clothing shops around the facility, perhaps because of the soldiers staying there.</sup></p>
<p id="L19"><br></p>
<p id="L20">This place is designed to resemble a legionary fortress in wartime, so it's quite large. In actual wars, they often set up facilities almost identical to this one on the front lines."<br><sup>「ここは戦時における軍団要塞を模したものになっているので、大きさもかなりのものになっていますね。実際に戦争が起こった際は、これとほぼ同じ施設を前線に設置することが多々あるようです」</sup><br><sup>"This place is quite large because it is modeled after the fortress of the legion during the war.In the event of a real war, there are many cases where almost the same facilities are installed on the front lines."</sup></p>
<p id="L21"><br></p>
<p id="L22">"The same thing as this? It looks as if you could build an entire city out of it."<br><sup>「これと同じものをですか。まるで街をまるごと作ってしまうような形ですね」</sup><br><sup>"The same thing as this?"It's like building a whole city."</sup></p>
<p id="L23"><br></p>
<p id="L24">Within the site, there are a number of one-story wooden buildings, evenly spaced.<br><sup>敷地内には、木造平屋の建物が等間隔でいくつも並んでいる。</sup><br><sup>Several wooden one-story buildings are lined up at equal intervals on the site.</sup></p>
<p id="L25">Each building has a different use, from barracks and armories to hospitals and food storage.<br><sup>建物ごとに用途は違い、兵舎や武器庫、病院や食料庫など、その種類は多岐にわたる。</sup><br><sup>Each building has its own use, and there are many different types, including barracks and arsenals, hospitals and pantry.</sup></p>
<p id="L26">The floor of the pantry was built about a meter higher than the ground, probably to avoid pests.<br><sup>食料庫は害虫避けのためか、床が地面より１メートルほど高く作られていた。</sup><br><sup>The pantry was built about a meter above the ground, perhaps to avoid pests.</sup></p>
<p id="L27">There were also a number of wooden watchtowers along the stone walls, which gave the place a rather grim atmosphere.<br><sup>また、石壁沿いには木製の見張り塔がいくつも建っていて、かなりものものしい雰囲気だ。</sup><br><sup>There are also many wooden watchtowers along the stone wall, which gives a very dignified atmosphere.</sup></p>
<p id="L28"><br></p>
<p id="L29">That's actually how it works. In the winter, both allies and enemies are unable to move, so they build fortresses on the front lines and winter there. In actual fortresses, they use earthen mounds and wooden fences instead of stone walls like this.<br><sup>「実際そんな感じですね。冬季になると敵も味方も身動きが取れなくなるので、それに合わせて前線に要塞を構築して、そこで越冬するんです。実際の要塞では、このような石壁ではなく土塁と木柵を用いるみたいですけどね」</sup><br><sup>"It's actually like that.In winter, neither the enemy nor our friends are able to move, so we build fortresses on the front and winter there.It seems that in actual fortresses, earth foundations and wooden fences are used instead of stone walls like this."</sup></p>
<p id="L30"><br></p>
<p id="L31">"I see. A temporary residence for the winter."<br><sup>「なるほど、冬季限定の仮住まいですか」</sup><br><sup>"Well, is it a temporary residence only for winter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L32"><br></p>
<p id="L33">According to Liese's explanation, fortresses of this shape are built as close to large rivers as possible.<br><sup>リーゼの説明によると、このような形の要塞は可能な限り大きな河川の近くに作られるらしい。</sup><br><sup>According to Liese, such a fortress will be built as close to the largest river as possible.</sup></p>
<p id="L34">Partly for the purpose of obtaining water for domestic use, but also because the ships can be used to communicate with other cities.<br><sup>生活用水を得るためという目的もあるが、船舶を使って他の街と連絡を取り合うことができるからだ。</sup><br><sup>It is also for the purpose of obtaining water for daily use, but it is possible to communicate with other towns by boat.</sup></p>
<p id="L35">Moving by river is much less expensive than moving by land, so if you can set up a camp in a place where you can use ships, it will be easier to transport goods.<br><sup>河川を用いた移動は陸上移動よりもはるかにコストがかからないので、船舶を使える場所に陣営を設置できれば物資の輸送も楽になる。</sup><br><sup>Since moving by river is much less expensive than moving by land, it will be easier to transport goods if you set up a camp where you can use ships.</sup></p>
<p id="L36">If there is a village or city nearby, they will build a fortress adjacent to it.<br><sup>近くに村や街がある場合は、それに隣接する形で要塞を構築するとのことだ。</sup><br><sup>If there is a village or town nearby, it will build a fortress adjacent to it.</sup></p>
<p id="L37"><br></p>
<p id="L38">I've heard that they're building a fort near the border with Balbert, but is there a difference in construction between that fort and a fortress like this?<br><sup>「そういえば、バルベールとの国境付近に砦を造っているって話を以前聞いたことがあるんですけど、その砦とこのような要塞とでは造りは別物なんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Come to think of it, I've heard of building a fort near the border with Valve. Is the fort different from such a fort?"</sup></p>
<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">It's not completely different, but the fort near the border is even larger than this one. It's more of a walled city than a fortress, since it has the functions of a city as well as a military garrison."<br><sup>「完全に別物というわけではありませんが、国境付近の砦はこの要塞よりもさらに大規模なものですね。軍団の駐留を前提として街の機能も備えているので、砦というよりも<ruby><rb>城郭都市</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>じょうかくとし</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>といったほうが正しいかもしれません」</sup><br><sup>"It's not completely different, but the fort near the border is even larger than this one.It is more appropriate to call it a castle city than a fort, since it is equipped with the functions of a city on the premise of the presence of an army."</sup></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42">It's like a smaller version of the castle city ...... of Isteria?"<br><sup>「城郭都市……イステリアの街を小さくしたようなものですかね？」</sup><br><sup>"Is it like a castle city... a small city of Isteria?"</sup></p>
<p id="L43"><br></p>
<p id="L44">Yes, I think that's the way it should be.<br><sup>「そうですね、そういったイメージで問題ないと思います」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I don't think that's a problem."</sup></p>
<p id="L45"><br></p>
<p id="L46">After walking around for a while, talking about such things, they arrived at the training grounds.<br><sup>そんな話をしながらしばらく歩いているうちに、２人は訓練場に到着した。</sup><br><sup>After walking for a while, the two arrived at the training ground.</sup></p>
<p id="L47">The training area was quite large, like a bare earth ground.<br><sup>訓練場はかなりの広さで、土がむきだしのグラウンドのようになっている。</sup><br><sup>The training ground is quite large and looks like a bare ground.</sup></p>
<p id="L48">There were at least several hundred heavily armed infantrymen in the center, all lined up with evenly spaced gaps between them.<br><sup>中央には重装歩兵が数百人はおり、全員が等間隔に隙間を空けた状態で整列していた。</sup><br><sup>There were hundreds of heavily-armed infantrymen in the center, all standing in line at equal intervals.</sup></p>
<p id="L49"><br></p>
<p id="L50">The soldiers were carrying long spears that were perhaps five meters long, and they wore bronze shields on their arms.<br><sup>兵士たちは長さが５メートルはあろうかという長槍を抱えていて、腕には青銅製の円盾を装着している。</sup><br><sup>Soldiers carry long spears of about five meters in length and wear bronze shields on their arms.</sup></p>
<p id="L51">The circular shield has a string attached to it, and it is shaped so that the shield can be hung by the string around the neck.<br><sup>円盾には紐が付いており、首に紐をかけて盾を吊るせるような形状だ。</sup><br><sup>The circular shield has a string attached to it, and it is shaped like a rope around the neck to hang the shield.</sup></p>
<p id="L52">The cavalry and archers were also lined up beside the heavily armed infantry, each of which looked to be about a hundred strong.<br><sup>重装歩兵の傍には騎兵と弓兵も整列しており、それぞれ１００人はいるように見える。</sup><br><sup>There are also cavalry and archers lined up beside the heavily armed infantry, each with about 100 soldiers.</sup></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54">In front of the soldiers, there was an elderly man wearing a magnificent suit of armor, and he was talking to the soldiers.<br><sup>兵士たちの前には一際立派な鎧を着けた初老の男がおり、兵士たちに向かって何かを話している。</sup><br><sup>In front of the soldiers was an elderly man in extraordinary armor who was telling the soldiers something.</sup></p>
<p id="L55">When the man noticed Lise's figure, he ran toward us.<br><sup>男はリーゼの姿に気づくと、こちらに向かって走ってきた。</sup><br><sup>When the man saw Liese, he ran towards me.</sup></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">"Dear Lise, we have been waiting for you. We are already prepared and at your command."<br><sup>「リーゼ様、お待ちしておりました。すでに準備は整っておりますので、いつでもご指示を」</sup><br><sup>"Liese, I've been waiting for you.I'm ready, and I'm ready to give you instructions."</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">"Thank you. Good day to you. Master Kazura, this is my training instructor, McGregor."<br><sup>「ありがとう、今日はよろしくね。カズラ様、こちらは訓練教官のマクレガーです」</sup><br><sup>"Thank you, I wish you all the best today.Mr. Kazura, this is McGregor, our training instructor."</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">After being introduced to Liese, McGregor turned to Kazura and bowed his head.<br><sup>リーゼに紹介されると、マクレガーは一良に向き直って頭を下げた。</sup><br><sup>When Liese introduced him, McGregor turned to Ichira and bowed his head.</sup></p>
<p id="L62">MacGregor is a man with the air of a seasoned old soldier, with grayish blond hair, sharp eyes, and a trimmed beard that grows from his temples to his chin.<br><sup>マクレガーは白髪交じりの金髪に鋭い目付き、そしてこめかみから顎にかけて生えている切りそろえられた髭が印象的な、いかにも熟練の老兵といった雰囲気の男だ。</sup><br><sup>McGregor was a very skilled old soldier with gray hair, keen eyes, and a trim beard growing from temple to chin.</sup></p>
<p id="L63">His body was sturdy and he was about six feet tall.<br><sup>身体つきはがっしりとしていて、身長は１８０センチといったところだろうか。</sup><br><sup>I wonder if she is about 180 centimeters tall because of her strong body.</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">"Kazura-sama, it's nice to meet you. My name is MacGregor Thrun, and I am in charge of training the soldiers.<br><sup>「カズラ様、お初にお目にかかります。兵の訓練指導を担当しております、マクレガー・スランと申します」</sup><br><sup>"Nice to meet you, Kazura.My name is McGregor Slan, and I am in charge of training and coaching soldiers."</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">My name is Kazura. I look forward to working with you today."<br><sup>「カズラと申します。本日はよろしくお願いします」</sup><br><sup>"My name is Kazura.I look forward to working with you today."</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">McGregor smiled as Kazura reflexively replied.<br><sup>反射的に一良が返答すると、マクレガーは笑顔を見せた。</sup><br><sup>McGregor smiled when Ichira replied reflexively.</sup></p>
<p id="L70"><br></p>
<p id="L71">I've heard that your nephew Isaac has been a great help to you. I hope you will continue to treat him well."<br><sup>「カズラ様には甥のアイザックが大変世話になっていると聞いています。今後とも、よくしてやってください」</sup><br><sup>"I've heard that Kazura-sama is very grateful to his nephew Isaac.I hope you will continue to take care of yourself.</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">Oh, nephew, are you two related?<br><sup>「え、甥って、お２人は親族なんですか」</sup><br><sup>"Are your nephews related?"</sup></p>
<p id="L74"><br></p>
<p id="L75">"Oh, you didn't know?"<br><sup>「おや、ご存知ありませんでしたか」</sup><br><sup>"Didn't you know that?"</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">McGregor looked surprised at Kazura's surprised expression.<br><sup>驚いた様子の一良に、マクレガーは意外そうな表情を見せた。</sup><br><sup>McGregor looked surprised at Ichira.</sup></p>
<p id="L78">Kazuyoshi had had many chances to talk to Isaac, but it had always been about work, and they had rarely chatted or talked about his personal life.<br><sup>一良は今まで何度もアイザックと話す機会はあったが、いつも仕事に関係する話ばかりで、雑談や彼の身の回りの話はほとんどしたことがなかった。</sup><br><sup>Ichira has had many opportunities to talk to Isaac, but he has always talked about his work, and has hardly talked about small talk or things around him.</sup></p>
<p id="L79"><br></p>
<p id="L80">It's the first time I've heard of it. Come to think of it, I've hardly ever talked about such things with Isaac. ......"<br><sup>「今初めて知りました。そういえば、アイザックさんとそういう話はほとんどしたことがなかったな……」</sup><br><sup>"I've never heard of it before.Come to think of it, I've hardly talked to Isaac about it..."</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">I don't know if that's true. Well, he doesn't seem to like to talk about his relatives. ...... I guess he doesn't like to be patronized just because his relatives are in important positions. It's probably best to leave it at that.<br><sup>「そうでしたか。まあ、あいつは親族がどうとかいう話はあまりしたがらないようですからな……親族が要職についているからといって、ひいきされるのが嫌なのでしょう。あまり触れないでやっておいたほうがいいかもしれません」</sup><br><sup>"Is that so?Well, he doesn't seem to want to talk much about his relatives... because he doesn't want to be favored just because they're in important positions.Maybe it's better not to touch it too much."</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">I see, that's just like him."<br><sup>「なるほど、彼らしいですね」</sup><br><sup>"Well, it's just like him,"</sup></p>
<p id="L85"><br></p>
<p id="L86">"He's not very good at what he does, but he's a reliable guy. I hope you'll continue to give him a hard time.<br><sup>「あいつはあまり要領はよくありませんが、信頼できる男です。今後とも、こきつかってやってください」</sup><br><sup>"He's not very tactful, but he's a reliable man.Please continue to work hard."</sup></p>
<p id="L87"><br></p>
<p id="L88">MacGregor bowed to Ichiran once more and turned to Lise.<br><sup>マクレガーはもう一度一良に頭を下げると、リーゼに向き直った。</sup><br><sup>McGregor bowed to Ryo once more and turned to Liese.</sup></p>
<p id="L89"><br></p>
<p id="L90">"Master Liese, the first thing I'm going to show you is the basic movements of a heavily armored infantryman, is that correct?"<br><sup>「リーゼ様、最初にお見せするものは、重装歩兵の基本的な動き方でよろしいですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Liese, is the first thing I'll show you the basic way of moving heavy infantry?"</sup></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">Yeah, that's fine. Are the cavalry and archers ready?"<br><sup>「ええ、それで構わないわ。騎兵と弓兵の準備も大丈夫？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, that's all right.Are you ready for cavalry and archers?"</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94">"Of course. We're ready to show it off at any time."<br><sup>「もちろんです。いつでもお披露目できる状態になっております」</sup><br><sup>"Of course.I'm ready to show you at any time."</sup></p>
<p id="L95"><br></p>
<p id="L96">"Thank you. Please keep it to what we talked about the other day."<br><sup>「ありがと。内容はこの間話したものでお願いね」</sup><br><sup>"Thank you. Please tell me what you said the other day."</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">"Yes, sir."<br><sup>「かしこまりました」</sup><br><sup>"Very well,"</sup></p>
<p id="L99"><br></p>
<p id="L100">McGregor bowed to Lise and ran to the soldiers in line.<br><sup>マクレガーはリーゼに一礼すると、整列している兵士たちの下へ走っていった。</sup><br><sup>McGregor bowed to Liese and ran under the ranks of soldiers.</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">Um, could it be that you went out of your way to set up the training for me?"<br><sup>「あの、もしかしてわざわざ私のために訓練の段取りを組んでくれたのですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, by any chance, did you go out of your way to arrange training for me?"</sup></p>
<p id="L103"><br></p>
<p id="L104">Yes, if you are going to see it, I want you to see it in its proper form. If you have any requests, please let me know. I'll have it ready for you right away.<br><sup>「はい、せっかく見ていただくのなら、やはりきちんとした形で見ていただきたくて。何かご要望があれば、都度おっしゃってください。すぐに用意させますから」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, if you're going to see it, I'd like you to see it in a proper way.If you have any requests, please let me know.I'll have it ready at once."</sup></p>
<p id="L105"><br></p>
<p id="L106">"I understand. I'm sorry I seem to have increased Liese's workload somehow. ......"<br><sup>「わかりました。何かリーゼさんの仕事増やしちゃったみたいですみません……」</sup><br><sup>"All right.I'm sorry that Liese seems to have increased her work..."</sup></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">Liese smiled as usual at Kazuyoshi, who said with a shrug.<br><sup>恐縮したように言う一良に、リーゼはいつものようににっこりと微笑む。</sup><br><sup>Liese smiles as usual at Ichira, who says she is afraid.</sup></p>
<p id="L109"><br></p>
<p id="L110">If I can be of any help to you, Kazura-sama, it won't bother me at all. Please don't hesitate to ask me for anything you need.<br><sup>「いえ、カズラ様のお役に立てるのなら、全く苦にはなりません。どうか遠慮などなさらず、何でも私に申し付けてください」</sup><br><sup>"No, if I can help Kazura, it won't bother me at all.Please don't hesitate to ask me anything."</sup></p>
<p id="L111"><br></p>
<p id="L112">"Infantry Company!"<br><sup>「歩兵中隊！」</sup><br><sup>"Fantry Company!"</sup></p>
<p id="L113"><br></p>
<p id="L114">As the two men talked, the soldiers seemed to be ready, and McGregor's command echoed through the training grounds.<br><sup>２人が話しているうちに兵士たちの準備は整ったようで、マクレガーの号令が訓練場に響き渡った。</sup><br><sup>As they spoke, the soldiers seemed to be ready, and McGregor's orders echoed through the training ground.</sup></p>
<p id="L115">It was quite loud, so loud that I could hear it clearly even from the edge of the training area.<br><sup>訓練場の端にいてもはっきりと聞こえそうなほどの、かなりの大声だ。</sup><br><sup>It's so loud that you can hear it clearly even at the edge of the training ground.</sup></p>
<p id="L116"><br></p>
<p id="L117">The heavily armed infantrymen responded at the top of their voices to the command and held their circular shields in front of their bodies.<br><sup>号令に合わせて重装歩兵たちは声を張り上げて返事をし、円盾を身体の前に構える。</sup><br><sup>At the command, the heavily armed infantry shouted back and held their shields in front of them.</sup></p>
<p id="L118">The circular shields hit their armor, and a dull metallic sound echoed around the area.<br><sup>彼らの鎧に円盾が当たり、鈍い金属音が辺りに響いた。</sup><br><sup>Their armor was struck by a circular shield, and a dull metallic sound echoed all around them.</sup></p>
<p id="L119"><br></p>
<p id="L120">"Tight formation!"<br><sup>「密集隊形！」</sup><br><sup>"Close formation!"</sup></p>
<p id="L121"><br></p>
<p id="L122">The heavily armed infantrymen immediately closed the distance between each other and formed a dense formation in a clean line.<br><sup>重装歩兵たちは即座に互いの距離を詰めると、綺麗に整列して密集隊形を作った。</sup><br><sup>The heavy infantry immediately narrowed their distance and formed a dense formation.</sup></p>
<p id="L123">There is a gap of about one meter in front and behind each soldier, but there is only enough space on either side to hold a spear.<br><sup>各兵士の前後には１メートル程度の隙間が空けられているが、左右には槍を構えられる程度の隙間しか空いていない。</sup><br><sup>There is a gap of about one meter between the front and rear of each soldier, but there is only a gap of about one meter between the left and right sides that can hold a spear.</sup></p>
<p id="L124"><br></p>
<p id="L125">"Prepare to spear!"<br><sup>「槍構え！」</sup><br><sup>"Prepare your spears!"</sup></p>
<p id="L126"><br></p>
<p id="L127">The soldiers in the front row put their left hands along the spears they were holding up and thrust them forward.<br><sup>最前列の兵士たちは掲げていた槍に左手を沿え、そのまま前方に向けて槍を突き出した。</sup><br><sup>The soldiers in the front row put their left hands on the spears they were holding up and thrust them forward.</sup></p>
<p id="L128">Those in the back row held their spears forward through the gap, while those behind them held their spears diagonally upward.<br><sup>後列の者は隙間から槍を前方に構え、その後ろの者たちは槍を斜め上に構える。</sup><br><sup>Those in the back row hold their spears forward through the gap, and those behind them hold their spears diagonally upward.</sup></p>
<p id="L129">Those further back held their spears diagonally upwards in a more inclined position.<br><sup>さらに後ろの者たちは、より傾斜をつけた状態で槍を斜め上に構えた。</sup><br><sup>Those behind him held their spears diagonally upward, more inclined.</sup></p>
<p id="L130"><br></p>
<p id="L131">"Oh, a phalanx formation. First time I've seen it live. ......"<br><sup>「おお、ファランクス隊形か。初めて生で見た……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, the Pharanx formation.I saw it live for the first time..."</sup></p>
<p id="L132"><br></p>
<p id="L133">Kazuyoshi marveled at the power of the battle formation that hundreds of soldiers were taking at once.<br><sup>数百人の兵士たちが一斉にとる戦闘隊形の迫力に、一良は感嘆の声を上げた。</sup><br><sup>Ichira exclaimed at the power of the battle formation of hundreds of soldiers.</sup></p>
<p id="L134">The formation that the soldiers are taking is called the Phalanx formation ......, also known as the heavily armed infantry dense formation, which is a combat formation that concentrates its offensive power in the front.<br><sup>兵士たちがとっている隊形は、ファランクス隊形……別名、重装歩兵密集方陣と呼ばれる、前面に攻撃力を集中した戦闘隊形だ。</sup><br><sup>The formation of the soldiers is the Phalanx formation... also known as the heavily armed infantry concentrated square, which is a combat formation with concentrated offensive power in front.</sup></p>
<p id="L135">By clumping together with a spear sticking out in front, they are overwhelmingly strong against the front.<br><sup>前面に槍を突き出した状態で一塊になることで、前面に対しては圧倒的な強さを誇る。</sup><br><sup>It boasts overwhelming strength against the front by sticking out a spear in front.</sup></p>
<p id="L136">Because of this, the formation is very vulnerable to attacks from both sides and needs to be protected in some way.<br><sup>その分、左右からの攻撃には非常に脆く、何らかの方法で側面を守る必要がある隊形だ。</sup><br><sup>Therefore, the formation is very vulnerable to attacks from left and right, and needs to be defended in some way.</sup></p>
<p id="L137"><br></p>
<p id="L138">I'm sure you've heard of it, but I'm not sure if you've seen it. Are they much different in appearance from the ones in Kazura-sama's country?"<br><sup>「他領や他国のものに比べると、イステリアの重装歩兵が持つ槍はかなり長いので目新しいかもしれないですね。カズラ様の国のものとは、だいぶ様相が違いますか？」</sup><br><sup>"Compared to those of other territories and other countries, the spears of the heavy infantry in Israel are quite long, so they may be novel.Is it very different from that of Kazura-sama?"</sup></p>
<p id="L139"><br></p>
<p id="L140">"Um, ......, well, not really, more like ......."<br><sup>「えっと……まあ、違うというかなんというか……」</sup><br><sup>"Well... well, it's not, it's kind of...."</sup></p>
<p id="L141"><br></p>
<p id="L142">While Kazuyoshi was stammering at Liese's question, "Forward! MacGregor's command sounded.<br><sup>リーゼの質問に一良が口ごもっているうちに、「前進！」とマクレガーの号令が響いた。</sup><br><sup>As Ichira hesitated at Liese's question, McGregor's command sounded.</sup></p>
<p id="L143">The infantrymen, with their spears at the ready, walked off in unison.<br><sup>歩兵たちは槍を構えたまま、一糸乱れぬ動きで歩き出す。</sup><br><sup>The infantry began to walk in perfect order with their spears in their hands.</sup></p>
<p id="L144">After a certain amount of progress, the order was given again and the troops stopped advancing.<br><sup>そしてある程度進むと再び号令がかかり、部隊は前進を止めた。</sup><br><sup>Then, after a certain amount of progress, the command was issued again, and the troops.</sup></p>
<p id="L145"><br></p>
<p id="L146">"Spears up!　Turn right!<br><sup>「槍掲げ！　右転換！」</sup><br><sup>"Put up the spear! Turn right!"</sup></p>
<p id="L147"><br></p>
<p id="L148">The soldiers immediately raised their spears and turned on the spot.<br><sup>兵士たちは即座に槍を掲げ、その場で回れ右をする。</sup><br><sup>The soldiers immediately raise their spears and turn right on the spot.</sup></p>
<p id="L149">And again, "Spear ready! and the phalanx formation was completed with the direction of attack at right angles to the previous one.<br><sup>そして再び「槍構え！」と号令がかかり、先ほどとは攻撃方向を直角にした状態のファランクス隊形が完成した。</sup><br><sup>Then again, the command was given, "Pierce ready!" and the phalanx formation was completed with the attack direction at right angles.</sup></p>
<p id="L150"><br></p>
<p id="L151">"You're well-trained. ...... Your movements are completely lean."<br><sup>「よく訓練されていますね……動きに全く無駄がない」</sup><br><sup>"You're well trained... there's no waste in your movements."</sup></p>
<p id="L152"><br></p>
<p id="L153">"The standing heavy infantry is the mainstay of the army. To maintain a high level of proficiency, constant training is essential."<br><sup>「常備の重装歩兵は軍の主力ですからね。高い練度を維持できるように、常に訓練は欠かせません」</sup><br><sup>"A standing heavy infantryman is the main force of the army.Training is essential to maintaining a high level of skill."</sup></p>
<p id="L154"><br></p>
<p id="L155">What will troop operations look like in a real war?"<br><sup>「実戦での部隊運用はどんな形になるんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"What will happen to the operation of troops in combat?"</sup></p>
<p id="L156"><br></p>
<p id="L157">Normally, light infantry and cavalry are placed next to the heavy infantry for close combat, ready to attack from both sides. We then move the troops forward, and while the infantry units are nailing the enemy, the cavalry will move in behind them and pin them down."<br><sup>「通常は重装歩兵の横に近接戦闘用の軽装歩兵と騎兵を配置して、左右からの攻撃に備えます。そのまま軍を前進させて、歩兵部隊が敵を釘付けにしている間に騎兵隊が敵の背後に回りこんで挟み撃ちにします」</sup><br><sup>"We usually have light infantry and cavalry for close combat next to heavy infantry to prepare for attacks from left to right.Keep the troops moving forward, and while the infantry is nailing the enemy, the cavalry goes around behind the enemy and attacks them."</sup></p>
<p id="L158"><br></p>
<p id="L159">What if the cavalry can't break through the enemy?"<br><sup>「騎兵隊が敵を突破できない場合は？」</sup><br><sup>"What if the cavalry can't break through the enemy?"</sup></p>
<p id="L160"><br></p>
<p id="L161">The heavy infantry will continue to destroy the center of the enemy, and when the enemy begins to break off, the remaining light infantry and cavalry will move directly into pursuit.<br><sup>「重装歩兵がそのまま敵の中央を撃破して、敵が壊走を始めたら残った軽装歩兵と騎兵がそのまま追撃に移ります」</sup><br><sup>"The heavy infantry immediately breaks through the enemy's center, and when the enemy starts to break down, the remaining light infantry and cavalry continue to chase."</sup></p>
<p id="L162"><br></p>
<p id="L163">So, what if the enemy cavalry attacked us in the back?<br><sup>「では、逆に敵の騎兵に背後を突かれたら？」</sup><br><sup>"Then, on the contrary, why don't you be stabbed behind by the enemy cavalry?"</sup></p>
<p id="L164"><br></p>
<p id="L165">In that case, the reserve troops, including the Kingsguard, stationed behind the heavy infantry will return fire. The reserves will be manned by the best of the army, so unless something goes wrong, they won't be able to break through."<br><sup>「その場合は、重装歩兵の後方に配置されている近衛兵を含む予備隊が応戦します。予備隊には軍の最精鋭を配置するので、余程のことがない限り突き崩されることはありません」</sup><br><sup>"In that case, reserve forces, including the Guards, who are stationed behind heavy infantry, will respond.We have the best troops in the reserve, so they won't be destroyed unless there's too much to spare."</sup></p>
<p id="L166"><br></p>
<p id="L167">With her eyes on the heavily armed infantrymen moving forward in an orderly fashion, Liese answered Kazuyoshi's question without hesitation.<br><sup>整然と進む重装歩兵たちに目を向けたまま、リーゼは一良の質問にすらすらと答える。</sup><br><sup>With her eyes fixed on the orderly heavily armed infantry, Liese readily answers Ichira's questions.</sup></p>
<p id="L168">As the two continued to talk about troop operations, the heavily armed infantry that had circled the square returned to their original positions.<br><sup>その後も部隊の運用について２人が話していると、広場を一回りした重装歩兵が元の位置にまで戻ってきた。</sup><br><sup>Afterwards, the two men talked about the operation of the unit, and the heavily armed infantrymen who circled the square returned to their original positions.</sup></p>
<p id="L169">The cavalry that had been standing by until then deployed to the left and right of the heavy infantry, and the archers formed a horizontal line in front of the heavy infantry.<br><sup>それまで待機していた騎兵は重装歩兵の左右に展開し、弓兵は重装歩兵の前面に横一列で整列する。</sup><br><sup>The cavalry, who had been waiting until then, unfolded to the left and right of the heavily armed infantry, and the archers lined up in a row in front of the heavily armed infantry.</sup></p>
<p id="L170"><br></p>
<p id="L171">At the command, the archers readied their bows and began shooting at the straw targets set up in front of them.<br><sup>号令に合わせて弓兵たちは弓を構え、前方に立てられている束ねた藁の的に向けて射撃を開始した。</sup><br><sup>In response to the command, the archers opened their bows and began shooting at the target of a bundle of straw in front of them.</sup></p>
<p id="L172">McGregor walks toward us again, as if he has finished giving instructions to his troops.<br><sup>部隊に指示を出し終えたのか、マクレガーが再びこちらへ歩いてくる。</sup><br><sup>McGregor walks this way again, perhaps because he has given instructions to the troops.</sup></p>
<p id="L173"><br></p>
<p id="L174">First it's a shooting war with bows, and then the infantry advance.<br><sup>「最初に弓による射撃戦で、その後で歩兵が前進するんですね」</sup><br><sup>"First it was a bow-to-bow fight, and then the infantry advanced."</sup></p>
<p id="L175"><br></p>
<p id="L176">Yes, originally, the stone throwers would shoot together, and then the light infantry equipped with spears would come forward, but those soldiers were only drafted, and I wish I could show you ...... them.<br><sup>「はい、本来なら投石兵も一緒に射撃を行い、その後は投槍を装備した軽装歩兵が前に出るのですが、それらの兵は徴兵で集められたものたちだけで……お見せできればよかったのですが」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, stone throwers usually shoot together, and then light-armed infantry with spears come forward, but I wish I could show them only to those who were recruited by conscription."</sup></p>
<p id="L177"><br></p>
<p id="L178">Perhaps judging that Kazuyoshi had no military knowledge at all, Lise explained the operation of the unit very carefully.<br><sup>一良には軍事的な知識が全くないと判断したのか、リーゼはとても丁寧に部隊の運用法について説明をする。</sup><br><sup>Perhaps he judged that Ichira had no military knowledge, Liese explains very politely how to operate the unit.</sup></p>
<p id="L179">In fact, Ichira's knowledge of the military as we see it now is limited to what he's seen in books and on TV, so he was very grateful for Lise's explanation.<br><sup>実際、今見ているような軍隊については本やテレビで見た程度の知識しか一良は持ち合わせていないので、リーゼの説明はとてもありがたい。</sup><br><sup>In fact, I'm very grateful for Liese's explanation because he only has the knowledge he saw in books and TV about the army he's watching now.</sup></p>
<p id="L180"><br></p>
<p id="L181">I wanted to see what it looked like. I wanted to see what it looked like. ...... By the way, Liese, you know a lot about military affairs. Do you study it on a regular basis?"<br><sup>「投石兵ですか。どんなものか見てみたかったですね……それにしても、リーゼさんは軍事に詳しいんですね。日頃から勉強をしているのですか？」</sup><br><sup>"A stonemason?I wanted to see what it was like... Even so, Liese knows a lot about the military.Do you study regularly?"</sup></p>
<p id="L182"><br></p>
<p id="L183">Yes, I'm learning how to use weapons and tactics from an early age, since I'll be the one leading the army in the future.<br><sup>「はい、将来は私が軍を率いる立場になるので、幼い頃から武器の扱いや戦術は学んでいるんです」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, in the future, I will lead the army, so I have learned how to handle weapons and tactics since I was young."</sup></p>
<p id="L184"><br></p>
<p id="L185">Ah, so that's why they train in the courtyard every morning.<br><sup>「ああ、だから毎朝中庭で訓練をしているのですね」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that's why you train in the courtyard every morning."</sup></p>
<p id="L186"><br></p>
<p id="L187">When Kazuyoshi had talked to Lise in the courtyard before, Lise had said, 'As a member of the Istair family, you have to get used to handling weapons.<br><sup>以前一良が中庭でリーゼと話した時、リーゼは『イステール家の者として、武器の扱いには慣れておかないといけない』と言っていた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira talked to Liese in the courtyard before, Liese said, 'As a member of the Istair family, you have to get used to handling weapons.'</sup></p>
<p id="L188">Since he was leading the army, he would have to be familiar with the handling of all the weapons used on the battlefield.<br><sup>軍を率いるからには、戦場で使用される全ての武器の取り扱いに精通しておかなければならないのだろう。</sup><br><sup>To lead the army, it is necessary to be familiar with the handling of all weapons used in the battlefield.</sup></p>
<p id="L189"><br></p>
<p id="L190">"You have a natural talent, Lise. In the future, you will be an excellent legion commander and will be active on the battlefield."<br><sup>「リーゼ様には天賦の才がありますからな。将来は優れた軍団長として、戦場で活躍なさることでしょう」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Liese has a natural gift,"In the future, he will be active in the battlefield as an excellent commander of the corps."</sup></p>
<p id="L191"><br></p>
<p id="L192">When McGregor returned to the two, he lined up next to Lise and turned his attention to the soldiers who were continuing their training.<br><sup>マクレガーは２人の下へ戻ってくるとリーゼの隣に並び、訓練を続けている兵士たちに目を向けた。</sup><br><sup>When McGregor returned to the two men, he lined up next to Liese and looked at the soldiers who were still training.</sup></p>
<p id="L193">The archers had finished firing, and the cavalrymen with short spears were advancing forward.<br><sup>弓兵たちの射撃が終わり、短槍を持った騎兵が前方へ進出している。</sup><br><sup>As the archers finished shooting, cavalry with short spears advanced.</sup></p>
<p id="L194">The heavily armed infantry had also begun to advance in a phalanx formation.<br><sup>重装歩兵も、ファランクス隊形のまま前進を始めていた。</sup><br><sup>Heavy-duty infantry also began to advance in the Phalanx formation.</sup></p>
<p id="L195"><br></p>
<p id="L196">"Well, I'm not that gifted. ...... I'd like to show Kazura-sama the pitchfork, if you know where I can find it."<br><sup>「え、そんな天賦の才なんて私には……それより、カズラ様に投石器をお見せしたいのだけど、どこかにないかしら？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, I can't believe I'm so talented... rather, I'd like to show Kazura a stone thrower, but is there any where?"</sup></p>
<p id="L197"><br></p>
<p id="L198">"We have a training sling and a staff sling. I'll bring them to you in a moment."<br><sup>「教練用のスリングとスタッフスリングがあります。今お持ちしますので、少々お待ちを」</sup><br><sup>"There are training slings and staff slings.I'll bring it to you now, so please wait a moment."</sup></p>
<p id="L199"><br></p>
<p id="L200">MacGregor bowed to Lise and entered the nearby barracks.<br><sup>マクレガーはリーゼに頭を下げると、近場の兵舎へと入っていった。</sup><br><sup>McGregor bowed to Liese and went into a nearby barracks.</sup></p>
<p id="L201"><br></p>
<p id="L202">Are those all the types of weapons used on the battlefield that you just told me about?"<br><sup>「戦場で使われる兵種は、今教えてもらったもので全部ですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Are all the soldiers you have just told me?"</sup></p>
<p id="L203"><br></p>
<p id="L204">"In Istair territory, yes. There is a document in the archives that summarizes the results of past battles, would you like to take a look at it later?"<br><sup>「イステール領ではそうですね。過去の戦闘結果をまとめた資料が資料室にありますが、後ほどご覧になりますか？」</sup><br><sup>"That's the case in Istair.I have some information in the archives that summarizes the results of past battles.

<p id="L205"><br></p>
<p id="L206">Yes, please."<br><sup>「そうですね、お願いします」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, please,"</sup></p>
<p id="L207"><br></p>
<p id="L208">As they were talking about this, McGregor returned from the barracks.<br><sup>２人がそんな話をしていると、マクレガーが兵舎から戻ってきた。</sup><br><sup>As they spoke, McGregor returned from the barracks.</sup></p>
<p id="L209">In his hands, he holds a weapon--a sling--a semicircular leather cup tied to two rope straps, a weapon tied to the end of a meter-long stick--a staff sling--and a target made of a large wooden board. --A staff sling, and a target with a large wooden board attached to it.<br><sup>手には半円形の革のカップが２本の縄紐で結び付けられた武器――スリング――と、１メートルほどの長さの棒の先にそれが結び付けられた武器――スタッフスリング――、大きな木の板が貼り付けられた的が握られてる。</sup><br><sup>In his hand he held a weapon -- a sling -- with two semicircular leather cups tied together by ropes, and a weapon tied to the end of a stick about a meter long -- a staff sling -- and a target with a large wooden board attached.</sup></p>
<p id="L210"><br></p>
<p id="L211">"Sorry to keep you waiting. Would Master Lise like to use it?"<br><sup>「お待たせしました。リーゼ様がお使いになられますか？」</sup><br><sup>"Thank you for your patience.Will Mr. Liese use it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L212"><br></p>
<p id="L213">"What?<br><sup>「え？」</sup><br><sup>"What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L214"><br></p>
<p id="L215">Lise was puzzled by the unexpected advance.<br><sup>予想外の進言に、リーゼは困惑した。</sup><br><sup>The unexpected suggestion baffled Liese.</sup></p>
<p id="L216">However, he glanced at Kazura, who was looking at them with interest, and took the sling from McGregor.<br><sup>だが、興味深げにそれらを見ている一良にちらりと目を向けると、マクレガーからスリングを受け取った。</sup><br><sup>But he glanced at Ichira, who was looking at them with interest, and received a sling from McGregor.</sup></p>
<p id="L217"><br></p>
<p id="L218">Would you prefer stone or lead bullets?"<br><sup>「<ruby><rb>石弾</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>せきだん</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>と<ruby><rb>鉛弾</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>なまりだま</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>のどちらになさいますか？」</sup><br><sup>"Which would you like, a stone bullet or a lead bullet?"</sup></p>

<p id="L222">"Very well, sir. How would you like the distance, sir?"<br><sup>「かしこまりました。距離はいかがいたしますか？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, sir.How far would you like to go?"</sup></p>
<p id="L223"><br></p>
<p id="L224">Closer, please. I'll shoot straight."<br><sup>「近めでお願い。直射するわ」</sup><br><sup>"Close, please.I'll shoot you straight."</sup></p>
<p id="L225"><br></p>
<p id="L226">McGregor handed Liese a cloth bag filled with lead bullets and ran about thirty meters ahead of her to set the target on the ground.<br><sup>マクレガーは鉛弾入りの布袋をリーゼに手渡すと、３０メートルほど先まで走り、的を地面につき立てた。</sup><br><sup>McGregor handed Liese a bag of lead-shot cloth, ran about 30 meters away, and pointed the target to the ground.</sup></p>
<p id="L227"><br></p>
<p id="L228">Can you use a stone thrower?"<br><sup>「投石器も使えるんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Can you use a stone thrower?"</sup></p>
<p id="L229"><br></p>
<p id="L230">"Yes, I've had some training.

It's dangerous, so please stay a little away."</sup></p>
<p id="L231"><br></p>
<p id="L232">Liese put a lead bullet in the cup of the sling and began to rotate the sling, holding one hand above her head.<br><sup>リーゼはスリングのカップに鉛弾を入れると、片手を頭上にかかげてスリングを回転させ始めた。</sup><br><sup>Liese put a lead bullet into the sling's cup and began to spin the sling with one hand over her head.</sup></p>
<p id="L233">The cup filled with lead bullets began to spin with tremendous force, and the sound of the wind breaking echoed in the air.<br><sup>鉛弾入りのカップがすさまじい勢いで回転を始め、風を切る音が当たりに響く。</sup><br><sup>The cup containing lead bullets began to spin at a tremendous rate, and the sound of the wind breaking echoed through the air.</sup></p>
<p id="L234">When the rotational speed reached its limit, he released one of the strings he was holding and a lead bullet was ejected at high speed.<br><sup>回転速度が限界に達したところで握っていた紐の片方を離すと、鉛弾が高速で射出された。</sup><br><sup>When the speed of rotation reached its limit, one of the strings was released and the lead shot out at high speed.</sup></p>

<p id="L236"><br></p>
<p id="L237">Well done.<br><sup>「お見事！」</sup><br><sup>"Excellent!"</sup></p>
<p id="L238"><br></p>
<p id="L239">McGregor claps his hands in praise with a satisfied look on his face.<br><sup>マクレガーが満足そうな表情で手を叩いて賛辞を述べる。</sup><br><sup>McGregor clapped his hands in compliment.</sup></p>
<p id="L240">Then the hundreds of soldiers who must have been training at a distance also cheered and clapped for Liese.<br><sup>すると、離れた場所で訓練をしていたはずの数百人の兵士たちも、歓声を上げてリーゼに拍手をした。</sup><br><sup>Hundreds of soldiers, who were supposed to have trained in remote places, cheered and applauded Liese.</sup></p>
