<p id="L3">Kazuyoshi, along with Liese and Zirconia, was in the mountainous region northwest of Isteria.<br><sup>一良はリーゼやジルコニアとともに、イステリア北西にある山岳地帯にいた。</sup><br><sup>Ichira, along with Liese and Zirconia, was in a mountainous area northwest of Isteria.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">The place where I am now is a riverbank near the middle of the mountain.<br><sup>今いる場所は、山の中腹付近の川べりである。</sup><br><sup>I'm at the edge of a river near the middle of the mountain.</sup></p>
<p id="L5">We were told that there was an abandoned farm a short walk from here.<br><sup>ここから少し歩いた先に、放棄された農場があるとのことだ。</sup><br><sup>A short walk from here is an abandoned farm.</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">The sky was already tinged with the color of sunset, and soldiers and followers were beginning to prepare for encampment around us.<br><sup>すでに空は夕焼け色に染っており、周囲では兵士と従者たちが野営準備を始めている。</sup><br><sup>The sky was already darkened by the sunset, and soldiers and their men were preparing.</sup></p>
<p id="L8">Fires were being built here and there in the encampment, and tents were being pitched one after another.<br><sup>野営地のあちこちで焚き火が焚かれ、次々と天幕も張られ始めていた。</sup><br><sup>Bonfires were burning all over the camp, and tents were being laid up one after another.</sup></p>
<p id="L9">Including the guards and craftsmen, there were probably well over a hundred of them.<br><sup>護衛や職人たちを含めると、１００人以上は優にいるだろう。</sup><br><sup>Including the guards and craftsmen, there will be more than a hundred of them.</sup></p>
<p id="L10">It was a very large group camp.<br><sup>かなりの大所帯による集団キャンプだ。</sup><br><sup>It's a large group camp.</sup></p>
<p id="L11"><br></p>
<p id="L12">"My back hurts. No matter how much I try, that carriage is shaking too much. ......"<br><sup>「こ、腰が痛え。いくらなんでもあの馬車揺れすぎだろ……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my back hurts.That carriage shakes too much, doesn't it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L13"><br></p>
<p id="L14">Kazuyoshi put his hands on his hips and stretched to turn his body.<br><sup>一良は腰に手を当て、身体を反らすように背伸びをした。</sup><br><sup>Ichira put his hand on his waist and stretched out as if he were leaning back.</sup></p>
<p id="L15">The three of us traveled by carriage to this point, but the mountain road was bumpy and the shaking in the carriage was terrible.<br><sup>ここまで３人は馬車で移動したのだが、山道はでこぼこしていて車内の揺れは酷いものだった。</sup><br><sup>So far, the three of them had traveled by coach, but the mountain path was uneven and the shaking in the car was terrible.</sup></p>
<p id="L16">Since there is no mechanism like a shock absorber, it is natural that vibrations are directly transmitted to the entire vehicle body.<br><sup>ショックアブソーバーのような機構がないため、振動が直に車体全体に伝わるので当然である。</sup><br><sup>Since there is no mechanism such as a shock absorber, vibration is transmitted directly throughout the body.</sup></p>
<p id="L17">Unaccustomed to traveling in a horse-drawn carriage, Kazuyoshi and Lise were unable to take a rest and kept clutching their handkerchiefs soaked in essential oil to prevent sickness.<br><sup>馬車の移動に不慣れな一良とリーゼはゆっくり休むこともできず、酔い止めの精油を染み込ませたハンカチをずっと握り締めていた。</sup><br><sup>Ichira and Liese, unfamiliar with the carriage movement, could not rest well and held a handkerchief soaked in essential oil for motion sickness.</sup></p>
<p id="L18"><br></p>
<p id="L19">Next time I'm back in Japan, I can look into the history of horse-drawn carriages and try to bring vibration reduction techniques to our world.<br><sup>次に日本に戻ったら、馬車の歴史を調べて振動軽減の手法をこちらの世界に持ち込んでみてもいいだろう。</sup><br><sup>The next time you return to Japan, you can look into the history of horse-drawn carts and introduce vibration mitigation techniques into this world.</sup></p>
<p id="L20">You can buy the shock absorber parts or the carriage itself and bring it in, but if you have some other method, you can use it.<br><sup>ショックアブソーバーの部品や馬車そのものを購入して持ち込んでしまってもいいが、何か別の手法があればそれを用いてみてもいい。</sup><br><sup>You can buy and bring shock absorber parts and carriages themselves, but you can try using them if you have another method.</sup></p>
<p id="L21"><br></p>
<p id="L22">"Dear Lise, are you all right?　Please sit down here."<br><sup>「リーゼ様、大丈夫ですか？　こちらに腰かけてください」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Liese, are you all right?"Please sit here."</sup></p>
<p id="L23"><br></p>
<p id="L24">"Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks."<br><sup>「うん、大丈夫。ありがとう」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, it's all right. Thank you."</sup></p>
<p id="L25"><br></p>
<p id="L26">Sitting down on the round chair that Eira had pulled out of the wagon, Lise let out a small sigh.<br><sup>エイラが荷馬車から引っ張り出した丸椅子に腰かけ、リーゼは小さく溜め息をついた。</sup><br><sup>Ayla sat in a round chair pulled out of the wagon, and Liese breathed a small sigh.</sup></p>
<p id="L27">He looked quite tired and slumped over.<br><sup>だいぶくたびれてしまっているのか、かなり疲れた表情でぐったりとしている。</sup><br><sup>Maybe he's very tired, but he's very tired and tired.</sup></p>
<p id="L28"><br></p>
<p id="L29">Near Ichiran and the others, the squires were beginning to prepare dinner.<br><sup>一良たちの近くでは、従者たちが夕食の準備を始めている。</sup><br><sup>Near Ichira and others, their servants began to prepare dinner.</sup></p>
<p id="L30">In the midst of her retinue, Marie was moving about in a flurry of activity.<br><sup>その従者たちにまじって、マリーもぱたぱたと慌しく動き回っていた。</sup><br><sup>Marie flapped about with her servants.</sup></p>
<p id="L31"><br></p>
<p id="L32">Eira and Marie were not dressed in their usual maidservants' uniforms, but were dressed lightly so that they could easily move around outdoors.<br><sup>エイラもマリーも、いつものような侍女服姿ではなく、屋外でも行動しやすいようにと身軽な服装だ。</sup><br><sup>Both Ayla and Marie wear light clothes so that they can move outdoors, not in their usual maid's clothes.</sup></p>
<p id="L33">He was also wearing leather boots instead of his usual shoes.<br><sup>履物も、いつものような靴ではなく革のブーツを履いている。</sup><br><sup>He also wears leather boots instead of his usual shoes.</sup></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35">Kazura-san, are you okay?"<br><sup>「カズラさん、大丈夫ですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Are you all right, Kazura?"</sup></p>
<p id="L36"><br></p>
<p id="L37">As Kazuyoshi held his waist and groaned, Zirconia called out to him in concern.<br><sup>一良が腰を押さえてうめいていると、ジルコニアが心配そうに声をかけてきた。</sup><br><sup>As Ichira gripped his back and groaned, zirconia spoke anxiously to him.</sup></p>
<p id="L38"><br></p>
<p id="L39">I'm okay somehow. But four days of horse-drawn carriage travel is indeed a painful experience. ......"<br><sup>「何とか大丈夫です。でも、馬車の移動が４日も続くとさすがに辛いものがありますね……」</sup><br><sup>"It's all right somehow.But if the carriage continues to move for four days, it will be really hard..."</sup></p>
<p id="L40"><br></p>
<p id="L41">It was quite a bumpy ride. Eira, please give Kazura-san's waist a squeeze after dinner."<br><sup>「道中、かなり揺れましたからね。エイラ、夕食後にカズラさんの腰を揉んでさしあげて」</sup><br><sup>"It shook quite a bit along the way.Ayla, rub Kazura's back after dinner."</sup></p>
<p id="L42"><br></p>
<p id="L43">"Yes, sir."<br><sup>「かしこまりました」</sup><br><sup>"Very well,"</sup></p>
<p id="L44"><br></p>
<p id="L45">"Oh, no, I'm fine there. You just need to rest a little and you'll be fine."<br><sup>「あ、いや、そこまでは大丈夫です。少し休んでいれば治りますから」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, no, that's all right.You'll get better if you take a little rest."</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">Zirconia gives instructions to Eira, and Kazura hurriedly declines.<br><sup>エイラに指示を出すジルコニアに、一良は慌てて断りを入れる。</sup><br><sup>Ichira hastily refuses zirconia, which gives instructions to Ayla.</sup></p>
<p id="L48">Eira and her followers must be tired from the long journey.<br><sup>エイラたち従者とて、長時間の移動で疲れているはずなのだ。</sup><br><sup>The Aylas must be tired from the long journey.</sup></p>
<p id="L49">It may be natural for me to be asked to serve in my position, but I don't feel comfortable asking you to do so much.<br><sup>立場的に奉仕してもらうのは当然なのかもしれないが、そこまでしてもらうのは気が引ける。</sup><br><sup>It may be natural to have them serve you from a standpoint, but I don't feel comfortable having them do that.</sup></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51">Incidentally, the attendants and artisans like Eira and the others who take care of Ichirō and the others are also transported in carriages.<br><sup>ちなみに、一良たちの世話をするエイラたちのような従者や職人たちも、馬車で移動させている。</sup><br><sup>By the way, servants and craftsmen like the Aylas who take care of Ichira and others are also moving them by coach.</sup></p>
<p id="L52">Traveling on foot were soldiers and other servants of the convoy, as well as civilian workers who had gathered to recruit workforce.<br><sup>徒歩での移動は、護衛の兵士やその他の使用人、作業人員の募集に集まってきた一般市民の労働者たちだ。</sup><br><sup>On foot, they are soldiers, other servants and ordinary citizens who have gathered to recruit workers.</sup></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54">I understand. But please don't push yourself too hard. If Kazura-san collapses now, I'll die from overwork.<br><sup>「分かりました。ですが、あまり無理はしないでくださいね。今カズラさんに倒れられたら、過労で私が死んでしまいます」</sup><br><sup>"All right, but don't push yourself too hard.If Kazura falls down now, I will die from overwork."</sup></p>
<p id="L55"><br></p>
<p id="L56">Zirconia jokingly says to the hesitant Kazura.<br><sup>遠慮している一良に、冗談めかしてジルコニアは言う。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia says jokingly to Ichira, who is reserved.</sup></p>
<p id="L57">Perhaps it is because we have been seeing each other from morning to night for so long, but Zirconia has lost the stiffness she used to have, and we have recently started to joke with each other.<br><sup>もうずっと朝から晩まで顔を合わせているせいか、ジルコニアからは以前のような堅苦しさがとれて、最近では冗談も言い合うようになってきた。</sup><br><sup>Maybe it's because we've been seeing each other all morning and all night, but zirconia has removed the stiffness of the past, and recently we've been joking with each other.</sup></p>
<p id="L58">The same is true for Narson, Isaac and the others, and lately they have been chatting a lot about their personal lives.<br><sup>ナルソンやアイザックたちも同様で、最近では身の回りのことなどの雑談もよくするようになっている。</sup><br><sup>Narson and Isaac are also doing the same thing, and these days, they often chat about things around them.</sup></p>
<p id="L59"><br></p>
<p id="L60">I'll give you lots of medicine that will make you feel better, so gulp it down and do your best. I'll be cheering you on from behind the grass.<br><sup>「その時は元気になる薬をたくさんあげますから、それをがぶ飲みして頑張ってください。私は草葉の陰から応援しています」</sup><br><sup>"At that time, I will give you a lot of medicine that will make you feel better, so please swallow it and do your best.I'm rooting for you from behind."</sup></p>
<p id="L61"><br></p>
<p id="L62">I don't like it. ...... I mean, Kazura-san should be the one taking that medicine, not me. We can do it later."<br><sup>「ぜ、絶対に嫌です……というか、私ではなくカズラさんがその薬を飲むべきですよ。私たちは後回しでいいですから」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I absolutely hate it... or Kazura-san, not me, should take the medicine.We don't have to put it off.</sup></p>
<p id="L63"><br></p>
<p id="L64">"Uh, ...... that medicine is specialized for people over here, so it doesn't really work for me. It's not that it doesn't work at all."<br><sup>「あー……あの薬って、こちらの人たちに特化したものなので、私にはあまり効かないんですよね。全く効かないというわけじゃないんですが」</sup><br><sup>"Ah... that medicine is specialized for these people, so it doesn't work very well for me.It doesn't mean it doesn't work at all."</sup></p>
<p id="L65"><br></p>
<p id="L66">When I said that, Zirconia looked a little surprised.<br><sup>そう言うと、ジルコニアは少し驚いたような表情を見せた。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia looked a little surprised.</sup></p>
<p id="L67">But soon, he nodded, "Is that so?" and returned his gaze to his squires who were continuing their work.<br><sup>だがすぐに、「そうなのですか」と頷き、作業を続けている従者たちに視線を戻した。</sup><br><sup>But soon he nodded, "Is that so?" and looked back at his servants, who were still working.</sup></p>
<p id="L68">As usual, they don't plan to ask in-depth questions about this kind of content.<br><sup>もういつものことだが、こういった内容について突っ込んだ質問をするつもりはないらしい。</sup><br><sup>As always, he doesn't seem to intend to ask any in-depth questions about this content.</sup></p>
<p id="L69"><br></p>
<p id="L70">It took me a long time to get here, by the way. I didn't think we'd spend four days just moving around. ......"<br><sup>「それにしても、ここまで来るのにずいぶんと時間がかかってしまいましたね。まさか移動だけで４日も使うとは思わなかったな……」</sup><br><sup>"And yet, it took a long time to get here.I didn't think I'd use it for four days just by moving...</sup></p>
<p id="L71"><br></p>
<p id="L72">The mountain road was unexpectedly steep, and it took us two days to reach here from the base of the mountain.<br><sup>山道は思いのほか険しく、山のふもとからここに到着するまでに２日も費やしてしまった。</sup><br><sup>The mountain path was steeper than I expected, and it took me two days to get here from the foot of the mountain.</sup></p>
<p id="L73">We also spent two days before arriving at the foot of the mountain from Isteria, so today was our fourth day of encampment.<br><sup>また、イステリアから山のふもとに到着するまでに２日使っているので、本日で野営４日目である。</sup><br><sup>Today is the fourth day of the camp, as I have used it for two days before reaching the foot of the mountain from the Easter.</sup></p>
<p id="L74"><br></p>
<p id="L75">We've brought a lot of people with us, a lot of mortar materials and camping equipment, so I think we've done rather well to get there in four days."<br><sup>「連れて来ている人数も多いですし、モルタル用の材料や野営道具をたくさん持ってきていますからね。４日でたどり着けたのは、むしろ上出来だと思います」</sup><br><sup>"We have a lot of people, and we have a lot of materials and camping gear for mortar.I think it was rather good that I was able to get there in four days."</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">Wagons loaded with lime, sand, and other supplies brought from Isteria were parked around the encampment.<br><sup>野営地の周囲には、イステリアから持ってきた石灰や砂などの物資を載せた荷馬車が停められている。</sup><br><sup>Trucks carrying lime and sand brought from Israel are parked around the camp.</sup></p>
<p id="L78">There is still not enough material to make the mortar for the ice pond, so we will have to transport it several times in the future.<br><sup><ruby><rb>氷池</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>ひいけ</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>用のモルタルを造るにはまだまだ材料が足りないので、今後も何回かに分けて輸送しなければならない。</sup><br><sup>Since mortar for ice ponds is still short of materials, it will have to be transported several times.</sup></p>
<p id="L79">We have dozens of artisans and laborers stationed at this place to do the work, and food needs to be brought in regularly.<br><sup>この場所には職人と労働者を何十人か常駐させて作業を行わせるので、食料も定期的に運ばせる必要がある。</sup><br><sup>Dozens of craftsmen and workers are stationed here to work, so food needs to be transported regularly.</sup></p>
<p id="L80"><br></p>
<p id="L81">An ice pond is a reservoir where water is stored to make ice.<br><sup>氷池とは、氷を作るために水を貯める溜め池のことだ。</sup><br><sup>An ice pond is a reservoir where water is stored to make ice.</sup></p>
<p id="L82"><br></p>
<p id="L83">Now that we've decided on the location of the waterwheel, we'll get up early tomorrow and get right to work on the rest of the project. We should be able to give all the work orders to the craftsmen by nightfall. If possible, I'd like to leave early the day after tomorrow.<br><sup>「水車を設置する位置は決めることができたので、明日は早起きしてすぐに他の作業に取り掛かりましょう。日暮れまでには職人たちに全ての作業指示を出してしまわないと。できることなら、明後日の早朝にはこちらを発ちたいですね」</sup><br><sup>"Now that we've decided where to place the waterwheel, let's get up early tomorrow and start working on something else.I have to give all the work instructions to the craftsmen by sunset.If possible, I'd like to leave here early the morning of the day after tomorrow."</sup></p>
<p id="L84"><br></p>
<p id="L85">The expression on Zirconia's face showed no sign of fatigue.<br><sup>そう言うジルコニアの表情には、疲労感は微塵も感じられない。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia's expression shows no signs of fatigue.</sup></p>
<p id="L86">Zirconia didn't seem to be fazed by the violent shaking of the car, and was leaning against the wall, taking a nap.<br><sup>ジルコニアは激しく揺れる車内でも動じる様子はなく、壁にもたれかかってすやすやと仮眠をとっていた。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia remained motionless even in the heavily shaken car, leaning against the wall and taking a sound nap.</sup></p>
<p id="L87">Kazuyoshi and Liese were dumbfounded at how they could sleep through all that shaking.<br><sup>あの揺れの中でよく眠れるものだと、一良とリーゼは唖然としたものだ。</sup><br><sup>Ichira and Liese were stunned that they could sleep well in the shaking.</sup></p>
<p id="L88"><br></p>
<p id="L89">"Well, yes. If we leave early in the morning the day after tomorrow, it will be seven days at the earliest before we get to Grisea Village. ...... Well, I guess that's just in time to receive the construction plans."<br><sup>「そうですね。明後日の早朝に出発するとなると、グリセア村に行くのは早くても７日後か……まあ、工事計画書の受け取りにはちょうどいい頃合ですかね」</sup><br><sup>"Well, if we leave early the morning of the day after tomorrow, it will be seven days at the earliest... well, it's time to receive the construction plan."</sup></p>
<p id="L90"><br></p>
<p id="L91">The first handover of the flood control plan will soon be due, so I would like to be back in Japan by then if possible.<br><sup>間もなく治水工事計画書の１度目の引渡し期日となるので、できればそれまでには日本に戻っておきたい。</sup><br><sup>It will soon be the first delivery date for the flood control work plan, so I would like to return to Japan by then if possible.</sup></p>
<p id="L92">It wouldn't be a problem if we were a few days late, but the director of the construction company that is designing the project has been out of touch for a while.<br><sup>数日受け取りが遅れたところで問題にはならないが、設計をしてくれている建設会社の取締役は一良に連絡がつかない状態だ。</sup><br><sup>It doesn't matter if it's delayed for a few days, but the director of the construction company that designed it has not been able to contact Ichira.</sup></p>
<p id="L93">If they don't hear from you for any length of time, they will feel uneasy, no matter how much they have paid in advance.<br><sup>いつまでたっても音沙汰なしでは、いくら前金を払っているとはいえ不安がられてしまうだろう。</sup><br><sup>No matter how much advance you pay without hearing from them, you will feel uneasy.</sup></p>
<p id="L94"><br></p>
<p id="L95">Incidentally, I have told Zirconia and the others about the river construction plan.<br><sup>ちなみに、河川工事計画書については、ジルコニアたちには話してある。</sup><br><sup>By the way, I have talked to zirconia about the river construction plan.</sup></p>
<p id="L96">I've already explained that the next reason I'm going back to Grisea Village is to retrieve the plans.<br><sup>次にグリセア村に戻る理由も、その計画書の回収が目的だと説明済みだ。</sup><br><sup>The next reason for returning to the village of Glyceria is to collect the plan.</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">"I'll put out a call for workers while you're in Grisea Village, Kazura-san. How many people do you need?"<br><sup>「カズラさんがグリセア村に行っている間に、作業人員の募集をかけておきますね。何人くらい必要ですか？」</sup><br><sup>"While Kazura is in the village of Glyceria, I'll try to recruit workers.How many people do you need?"</sup></p>
<p id="L99"><br></p>
<p id="L100">I don't know much about what's in the ...... plan, so I don't know how many people we'll need to mobilize yet. I think we should keep some carpenters and plasterers on hand.<br><sup>「えっと……計画書の中身がどうなっているのか私も詳しくは知らないんで、どれだけの人数を動員するのかはまだ分からないんです。大工職人や石膏職人は、ある程度確保しておいたほうがいいと思います」</sup><br><sup>"Well... I don't know exactly what's going on in the plan, so I still don't know how many people I'm going to mobilize.I think carpenters and gypsum workers should be kept to a certain extent."</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">"Carpenters and plasterers? ...... Carpenters are already being pulled out all over the place, so hopefully we won't need too many of them. ......"<br><sup>「大工職人と石膏職人ですか……大工職人はすでにあちこちで引き抜いている状態なので、あまり多人数が必要にならなければいいのですが……」</sup><br><sup>"Carpenters and gypsum artisans... I hope you don't need too many carpenters because they've already been pulled out here and there..."</sup></p>
<p id="L103"><br></p>
<p id="L104">When she heard that they were going to pull out more craftsmen, Zirconia looked worried.<br><sup>さらに職人を引き抜くと聞き、ジルコニアは不安そうな表情になった。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia looked uneasy when she heard that she would pull out the craftsman.</sup></p>
<p id="L105"><br></p>
<p id="L106">We hope to finish the partial renovation by next year's rainy season, so we still have time to spare. If we can't get enough craftsmen, we'll have to push back the whole project a bit. That's all we can do."<br><sup>「来年の雨季までに部分改修を終えることができればいいので、期間的にはまだ余裕があります。職人が確保できないようならば、計画を全体的に少し後ろ倒しにしましょう。こればかりは仕方がないですよ」</sup><br><sup>"It would be nice if we could finish some of the renovations by next rainy season, so we still have time to spare.If you can't secure a craftsman, let's put the whole plan back a little overall.There is nothing we can do about it."</sup></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">"Yes. ...... It depends on the nature of the work, but most of those who have served in the military have experience in building encampments and fortifications. They should be familiar with simple carpentry work, so let's mobilize those with military experience first."<br><sup>「そうですね……作業の内容にもよりますが、軍に所属していた者のほとんどは野営地や要塞構築の経験があります。簡単な大工仕事なら慣れているはずなので、軍経験者を優先して動員しましょう」</sup><br><sup>"Well... it depends on the content of the work, but most of the people who belonged to the military have experience building camps and fortresses.If it's a simple carpenter job, you'll be used to it, so let's mobilize people with military experience first."</sup></p>
<p id="L109"><br></p>
<p id="L110">I see. That's a good idea.<br><sup>「なるほど、それはいい考えですね」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's a good idea,"</sup></p>
<p id="L111"><br></p>
<p id="L112">The river improvement work to be done this time is only partial, so we won't need that many people.<br><sup>今回行われる河川改修工事は部分的なものなので、そこまで大人数は必要にはならないだろう。</sup><br><sup>The river renovation work to be carried out this time is only a small part, so it will not be necessary for such a large number of people.</sup></p>
<p id="L113">However, there is an overwhelming shortage of artisans as they are being pulled out from all over the place.<br><sup>だが、あちこちで職人を引き抜いているために職人の数が圧倒的に不足している。</sup><br><sup>However, the number of craftsmen is overwhelmingly insufficient due to the fact that they are recruiting craftsmen everywhere.</sup></p>
<p id="L114">We can't afford to delay the development of machine tools, so it will be inevitable that river construction will be delayed.<br><sup>工作機械の開発を遅らせるわけにはいかないので、河川工事が遅れるのは仕方がないだろう。</sup><br><sup>Since the development of machine tools cannot be delayed, it is inevitable that river construction will be delayed.</sup></p>
<p id="L115"><br></p>
<p id="L116">Also, we want the citizens who will be working on this project to be able to work on the main renovation and street maintenance after the partial renovation. So, please do not dissolve the contract after this work is finished, but keep the contract with us. During the rainy season, they can be assigned to other work.<br><sup>「あと、今回作業に充てる市民には、部分改修後の本改修や街道整備などの仕事にもついてもらいたいんです。なので、今回の工事が終わった後も解散にはせずに契約は継続したままにしておいてください。雨季の間は他の仕事に回してもらってもいいんで」</sup><br><sup>"Also, I would like to ask citizens who are dedicated to the work this time to get involved in maintenance and highway maintenance after partial renovation.Therefore, please do not dissolve the contract after this construction is completed and keep the contract going.You can transfer me to another job during the rainy season."</sup></p>

<p id="L122">"Hmm?"<br><sup>「ん？」</sup><br><sup>"Huh?"</sup></p>
<p id="L123"><br></p>
<p id="L124">As Ichirō and Zirconia were talking, Lise, who had been listening in silence until then, approached them.<br><sup>一良とジルコニアが話し込んでいると、それまで黙って聞いていたリーゼが声をかけてきた。</sup><br><sup>As Ichira and Zirconia were talking, Liese, who had been listening silently, spoke to them.</sup></p>
<p id="L125"><br></p>
<p id="L126">'Are there many other people like Kazura in the Land of Kazura?　Like Master Ormusiol or Master Gaielsior?"<br><sup>「カズラの国って、他にもカズラみたいな人が沢山いるの？　オルマシオール様とかガイエルシオール様とか」</sup><br><sup>"Is there a lot of other people like Kazura in the land of Kazura?"Like Mr. Olmasiol or Mr. Guyersiol."</sup></p>
<p id="L127"><br></p>
<p id="L128">Lise speaks in a whisper, perhaps concerned that the soldiers around her will not hear her.<br><sup>周囲の兵士たちに聞かれないようにと気遣っているのか、リーゼは小声で話す。</sup><br><sup>Liese talks in a low voice, wondering if she is worried that the soldiers around her will not hear her.</sup></p>
<p id="L129">Ormaciol is the god of war, and Gaierciol is the god of commerce.<br><sup>オルマシオールとは戦いの神、ガイエルシオールとは商売の神のことだ。</sup><br><sup>Ormaciol is the god of battle, and Guyersiol is the god of trade.</sup></p>
<p id="L130"><br></p>
<p id="L131">"I'd say they are. There are all kinds of things like that."<br><sup>「いるといえばいるよ。それっぽいのが色々と」</sup><br><sup>"If you say yes, yes.There are a lot of things that seem like that kind of thing."</sup></p>
<p id="L132"><br></p>
<p id="L133">So, yeah. If ...... that's the case, why don't you bring someone directly from that field to help you?　Kazura is in charge of mercy ......, uh, salvation and fertility, right?　I don't think Kazura has to do everything by herself.<br><sup>「そ、そう。……だったら、その分野の人を直接連れて来て手伝ってもらえばいいんじゃない？　カズラは、慈悲……ええと、救済と豊穣が管轄なんでしょ？　何もカズラが全部１人でやらなくてもいい気がするんだけど」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's right. Then why don't you bring someone from that field directly and get help?"Cazura is under the jurisdiction of mercy... well, salvation and fertility, right?I don't think Kazura has to do anything by himself."</sup></p>
<p id="L134"><br></p>
<p id="L135">Ichiran was at a loss for words as to what to say to Lise, who looked at him with a puzzled expression.<br><sup>いぶかしむような表情で言うリーゼに、一良は何と答えるべきかと言葉を詰まらせる。</sup><br><sup>When Liese says with a questioning expression, Ichira is at a loss for words to answer.</sup></p>
<p id="L136">It's a very sensitive subject, but when I think about it, it's a wonder that this kind of thing hadn't been discussed before.<br><sup>かなり際どい内容の話だが、思えば今までこういった話が出なかったことのほうが不思議に思えた。</sup><br><sup>It was quite a close story, but when I think about it, it seemed more strange that such a story had not been mentioned before.</sup></p>
<p id="L137">The idea of abandoning the God setting and letting it all hang out in the open comes to mind.<br><sup>いっそのこと神様設定を放棄してしまい、全部ぶっちゃけてしまってはどうだろうかという考えが頭に浮かぶ。</sup><br><sup>I'd rather give up God's setting and tell everything to him.</sup></p>
<p id="L138"><br></p>
<p id="L139">It is clear to everyone that Ichiran's deeds to date have far surpassed the lore of Gracior.<br><sup>現在までの一良の行いは、グレイシオールの言い伝えをはるかに凌ぐほどの内容であることは誰の目にも明らかだ。</sup><br><sup>It is clear to everyone that Ichira's actions so far are far more than Graciol's.</sup></p>
<p id="L140">Even if Kazuyoshi confessed, "Actually, I'm not a god, I'm just an ordinary human from another world," I would still be shocked to hear him say, "Really?　You liar!　I'll beat you to death! I'm going to kill you!<br><sup>もし一良が「実は私は神様じゃなくて、別の世界からやってきた普通の人間なんです」と白状したとしても、「そうだったのか！　この嘘つきめ！　ぶち殺してやる！！」とはならないだろう。</sup><br><sup>If Ichira confesses, "Actually, I'm not a god, I'm an ordinary person from another world," he won't be like, "I see! You liar! I'll knock you to death!"</sup></p>
<p id="L141">However, the only advantage of being frank is that you don't have to explain your lies and you don't feel guilty about lying.<br><sup>しかし、ぶっちゃけた場合のメリットといえば、めんどくさい嘘の説明をする必要がなくなるということと、嘘をついているという後ろめたさがなくなるといったことくらいだ。</sup><br><sup>However, the advantages of being frank are that you don't have to explain troublesome lies anymore and that you don't have to feel guilty about lying.</sup></p>
<p id="L142"><br></p>
<p id="L143">On the other hand, when I thought about what the disadvantages would be, a number of unpleasant thoughts came to mind, such as the possibility that Kazuyoshi himself might be imprisoned or tortured for absorbing knowledge, or that the villagers of Grisea Village might be taken hostage.<br><sup>逆にデメリットは何だろうかと考えると、知識の吸い上げのために一良自身が監禁や拷問をされたり、グリセア村の村人たちが人質に取られたりするかもしれないといった嫌な考えがいくつも浮かんだ。</sup><br><sup>On the other hand, when I thought about the disadvantages, I had many bad thoughts that Ichira might be imprisoned, tortured, or that the villagers of Glyceria might be held hostage in order to absorb knowledge.</sup></p>
<p id="L144">I don't think Narson and the others are the kind of people who would do such a thing, but I can't be sure about this.<br><sup>ナルソンたちはそんなことをするような人間ではないとは思うが、こればかりは断言はできない。</sup><br><sup>I don't think Narusons are the kind of people to do such a thing, but I can't say for sure.</sup></p>
<p id="L145">However, it is certain that Narson and the others will not probe anything or put any restrictions on Kazuyoshi's actions because they believe that Kazuyoshi is a god named Gracior.<br><sup>だが、一良がグレイシオールという神だと信じているからこそ、ナルソンたちは何も探りを入れてこないし、一良の行動に何も制限をかけてこないということは確かだろう。</sup><br><sup>However, it is certain that the Narusons do not seek anything because they believe that Ichira is a god called Graciol, and that they do not impose any restrictions on Ichira's behavior.</sup></p>
<p id="L146"><br></p>
<p id="L147">Thinking about it this way, it seemed that there was little advantage to daring to reveal oneself.<br><sup>こうして考えてみると、あえて自分から正体をぶっちゃけるメリットはほとんどないように感じられた。</sup><br><sup>When I thought about it this way, I felt that there was little merit in revealing my true identity.</sup></p>
<p id="L148">If the setting as a god, which is still in a messy state, is working, then it's better to let it go.<br><sup>このままぐだぐだ状態な神としての設定でも、上手くいっているのならそのまま通したほうがよさそうだ。</sup><br><sup>Even if it's set up as a lazy god, if it's going well, it's better to just let it pass.</sup></p>
<p id="L149">Since there is no such thing as a guideline for what God is like, Narson and his friends would have to assume that this is how it is.<br><sup>神様とはこういうものだ、といった指針など存在しないので、ナルソンたちからしてみれば「こういうものなのか」と思わざるを得ないだろう。</sup><br><sup>There is no such guideline as this as God, so from the perspective of the Narusons, they must wonder, "Is this what it is?"</sup></p>
<p id="L150"><br></p>
<p id="L151">"(I mean, what the hell is a 'god'? ......)"<br><sup>「（ていうか、『神様』っていったい何なんだろうな……）」</sup><br><sup>"(I mean, I wonder what 'God' is all about...)"</sup></p>
<p id="L152"><br></p>
<p id="L153">"You have your own problems, Kazura-san. We're the ones who forced her to help us, so don't embarrass her too much."<br><sup>「カズラさんにも色々と事情があるのよ。私たちが無理を言って助けてもらっているのだから、あまり困らせちゃダメよ？」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Kazura has a lot of reasons, too.We're pushing ourselves too hard for help, so don't put us in too much trouble."</sup></p>
<p id="L154"><br></p>
<p id="L155">When Ichiran was stifled by these thoughts, Zirconia interrupted him to admonish Lise.<br><sup>一良がそんなことを考えて押し黙っていると、ジルコニアがリーゼを諭すように口を挟んだ。</sup><br><sup>As Ichira kept silent thinking about it, Zirconia interrupted Liese as if to persuade him.</sup></p>
<p id="L156"><br></p>
<p id="L157">"Yeah, I didn't mean to. ......"<br><sup>「え、私そんなつもりじゃ……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that's not what I meant..."</sup></p>
<p id="L158"><br></p>
<p id="L159">"Well, I'll go check the road to the field while I'm at it. You can go ahead and have dinner."<br><sup>「さてと、私は今のうちに畑までの道を確認してきますね。夕食は先に食べていてください」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I'll check the way to the field before long.Please eat dinner first."</sup></p>
<p id="L160"><br></p>
<p id="L161">Zirconia said, and walked off into the dimly lit forest alone.<br><sup>ジルコニアはそう言うと、１人で薄暗い森の方へと歩いて行ってしまった。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia said so, and walked away by herself into the dim forest.</sup></p>
<p id="L162">As Zirconia walked away, Lise stared at her with an unrepentant expression on her face.<br><sup>去っていくジルコニアの背を、リーゼは釈然としない表情で見つめていた。</sup><br><sup>Liese stared at Zirconia's back, who was going away.</sup></p>

<p id="L167"><br></p>
<p id="L168">Kazuyoshi was sitting on a rock alongside Lise, looking out over the river as they ate dinner.<br><sup>一良はリーゼと並んで岩に座り、川を眺めながら夕食をとっていた。</sup><br><sup>Ichira was sitting alongside Liese on a rock, looking at the river and having dinner.</sup></p>
<p id="L169">The two of them are sitting on a large flat rock that sits on the riverbank.<br><sup>２人が座っているのは、川べりに鎮座している大きな平たい岩だ。</sup><br><sup>They are sitting on a large flat rock sitting by the river.</sup></p>
<p id="L170">Next to each of them was a spread of cloth, wooden bowls filled with stew, bread and fruit wine.<br><sup>それぞれの隣には敷き布が敷かれ、煮込み料理の入った木の椀や、パンや果実酒が置かれている。</sup><br><sup>Next to each is a wooden bowl of boiled food, bread and sake.</sup></p>
<p id="L171">Normally we would have eaten in the tent, but Kazuyoshi suggested that we eat at the riverbank.<br><sup>本来ならば天幕の中で食事をとるのだが、一良の提案で川べりで食事をとることになったのだ。</sup><br><sup>Originally, he would eat in the tent, but at Ichira's suggestion, he would eat by the river.</sup></p>
<p id="L172"><br></p>
<p id="L173">The flames of a nearby bonfire softly illuminated the surroundings, and the sound of water flowing down the river echoed around us.<br><sup>近くで燃える焚き火の炎が周囲を柔らかく照らし、さらさらと川を流れる水の音が辺りに響いている。</sup><br><sup>The flames of nearby bonfires gently illuminated the surroundings, and the sound of water flowing through the river echoed around.</sup></p>
<p id="L174">Perhaps it was the effect of the change of location, but eating in such a beautiful natural setting was the most delicious meal I had had in the past few days.<br><sup>転地効果というのか、こうして美しい自然の中で食べる食事は、ここ数日の間で一番美味しく感じられた。</sup><br><sup>The food I eat in this beautiful nature has been the most delicious thing in the past few days, perhaps because of the effect of changing places.</sup></p>
<p id="L175"><br></p>
<p id="L176">I see. If someone did that to me, I'd be tempted to say, 'I hope he dies.<br><sup>「なるほど、確かにそんなことをされたら、『死ねばいいのに』って言いたくもなるよな」</sup><br><sup>"Well, if you do such a thing, you'll want to say, 'I wish I were dead.'"</sup></p>
<p id="L177"><br></p>
<p id="L178">Right?"　There have been a few times before when he touched me physically, and it was really weird. ...... Ah, now that I remember, I'm so angry!"<br><sup>「でしょう？　前にも身体を触ってきたことが何回かあったし、もう本当に気持ち悪くて。……あー、思い出したら腹が立ってきた！」</sup><br><sup>"Right? I've touched my body a few times before, and it's already really disgusting... oh, I got angry when I remembered it!"</sup></p>
<p id="L179"><br></p>
<p id="L180">Lise is pouting and angry as she shreds the bread and throws it in her mouth.<br><sup>パンを千切って口に放り込みながら、リーゼはぷんすかと怒っている。</sup><br><sup>Liese is furious as she throws the bread into her mouth.</sup></p>
<p id="L181">What they are talking about now is about Lise's visitor.<br><sup>今２人が話している内容は、リーゼの面会相手についてのものだ。</sup><br><sup>What they are talking about is Liese's visitor.</sup></p>
<p id="L182">Seeing Lise exhausted from dealing with the frequent visitors, Kazuyoshi had been wondering for some time what kind of people would be coming.<br><sup>頻繁に訪れる面会者の相手でヘロヘロになっているリーゼを見て、どんな人たちがやってくるのかと一良は以前から気になっていた。</sup><br><sup>When he saw Liese, who was exhausted with frequent visitors, he had always wondered what kind of people would come.</sup></p>
<p id="L183">So, I casually asked her about the incident at the grocery store the other day, but Liese, who was so exasperated, started complaining like a dam.<br><sup>そこで、この間の雑貨屋での一件も交えて何気なく話を振ってみたのだが、鬱憤が溜まっていたリーゼの口からは堰を切ったように愚痴がこぼれだすという結果になっている。</sup><br><sup>So I casually talked about it with him at the general store the other day, but it turned out that Liese, who was angry, began to complain like a weir.</sup></p>
<p id="L184"><br></p>
<p id="L185">"But if you don't like it so much, why don't you just say no?　If you're not going to marry him, there's no need to keep visiting him.<br><sup>「でも、そんなに嫌なら断っちゃえばいいんじゃないか？　そいつと結婚するつもりがないなら、別に無理して面会を続ける必要はないだろ」</sup><br><sup>"But if you don't like it that much, why don't you refuse?"If you don't intend to marry him, you don't have to force yourself to continue seeing him."</sup></p>
<p id="L186"><br></p>
<p id="L187">I don't know, I can't do it. Most of them support the Istair family through commercial deals and business connections. Most of them support the Istaire family through commercial deals and business connections, and many of them have been very accommodating since I started visiting them, so if I refuse outright, it would be a problem for your father and mother."<br><sup>「んーん、そうもいかないの。簡単に断って悪い評判広められるのも嫌だし、大抵の人は商業取引とか仕事の口利きとかでイステール家を支援してくれてるのよ。私が面会するようになってから色々と融通してくれるようになった人も多いから、無下に断ったらお父様やお母様に迷惑がかかるわ」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's not the case.I don't want to get a bad reputation by saying no easily, and most people support the Istair family by doing business or meddling.Many people have come to accommodate me in many ways since I started visiting them, so if I refuse without permission, it will cause trouble to my father and mother."</sup></p>
<p id="L188"><br></p>
<p id="L189">When Liese said this, there was not the slightest hint of reserve or formality that I had felt a few days ago.<br><sup>そう話すリーゼには、数日前まで感じられたような遠慮や堅苦しさは微塵も感じられない。</sup><br><sup>Liese, who speaks so, doesn't feel the slightest restraint or rigidity that she felt until a few days ago.</sup></p>
<p id="L190">Liese was trying to be completely honest with him, as Ichiran had suggested, by dropping the honorifics and going out with him in his natural state.<br><sup>リーゼは敬語をやめて素の状態で付き合おうという一良の提案どおり、完全に素の状態で接するように心がけていた。</sup><br><sup>Liese tried to treat him completely as Ichira suggested to stop using honorifics and go out with him in his true state.</sup></p>
<p id="L191">But to be honest, I'm still not completely used to it, and I'm finding it hard to do.<br><sup>だが正直なところ、まだ完全には慣れておらず、やりにくさも感じてはいる。</sup><br><sup>To be honest, however, I'm not quite used to it and find it difficult to do it.</sup></p>
<p id="L192"><br></p>
<p id="L193">"Yeah, so does that mean that everyone is looking out for the Istres in various ways because of Lise?"<br><sup>「え、ということは、みんなリーゼが目当てで色々とイステール家に気を使ってるってこと？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, does that mean everyone cares about the Istair family for Liese?"</sup></p>
<p id="L194"><br></p>
<p id="L195">There are a lot of people who are courting me for my position as lord, so I don't think they're all after me. I guess it's been like this for years."<br><sup>「領主の地位が目当てで言い寄ってきてる人もたくさんいるから、全員が私目当てってわけじゃないと思うよ。もう何年も前からずっとこんな感じかな」</sup><br><sup>"I don't think everyone is after me, because there are many people who come to me for the lordship.It's been like this for years now."</sup></p>
<p id="L196"><br></p>
<p id="L197">Liese speaks plainly, without any emotion whatsoever.<br><sup>何の感慨もなさげに、リーゼは淡々と話す。</sup><br><sup>Without any emotion, Liese speaks calmly.</sup></p>
<p id="L198"><br></p>
<p id="L199">So I'm not going to get married unless it's to someone who has some power and is rich. But I definitely don't want a creepy guy like Nibel, or someone who thinks he can become a lord and do whatever he wants. Also, I don't like people who are too stingy.<br><sup>「だから、ある程度権力があってお金持ちの相手とじゃないと結婚するつもりはないの。とはいっても、ニーベルみたいな気持ち悪い奴とか、領主になって好き勝手やってやろうって考えてるような奴は絶対嫌だけど。あと、逆にケチケチしすぎてる人も嫌かな」</sup><br><sup>"So I'm not going to get married unless I'm with a certain amount of power and a rich man, but I don't want a disgusting fellow like Nibel, or someone who wants to be a lord and have his own way.And on the other hand, I don't like people who are too stingy."</sup></p>
<p id="L200"><br></p>
<p id="L201">"Really? Liese's having a hard time too. ...... Do people woo you with the intention of marrying you from the start?"<br><sup>「マジか。リーゼも苦労してるんだな……みんな最初から結婚を狙って言い寄ってくるのか」</sup><br><sup>"Really? Liese is having a hard time, isn't she? Do they all come up to me to get married from the beginning?"</sup></p>
<p id="L202"><br></p>
<p id="L203">It seemed like a difficult position to be in, and Kazuyoshi said sympathetically.<br><sup>何ともしんどい立場にあるように思え、同情するように一良は言う。</sup><br><sup>Kazura seems to be in a very difficult position and says sympathetically.</sup></p>
<p id="L204">Her status as the daughter of a lord was too great to allow her to casually fall in love, even if there were many people who wanted to woo her.<br><sup>領主の娘というステータスが大きすぎて、言い寄ってくる者が沢山いたとしても、気軽に恋愛などできるはずがない。</sup><br><sup>The status of the lord's daughter is so great that even if there were many people who approached her, she would not be able to fall in love easily.</sup></p>
<p id="L205">Moreover, several of the visitors seemed to be out-of-the-ordinary men like Nibel.<br><sup>しかも面会に来る者の中には、ニーベルのような常識はずれな男も何人かいるようだ。</sup><br><sup>and among those who came to see him there seemed to be some men like Nibel who were out of common sense.</sup></p>
<p id="L206">The stress of having to deal with all these people must have been quite a burden for the young Lise.<br><sup>そういった者たちの相手もしなければならないというストレスは、年若いリーゼにとってかなりの負担になっていることだろう。</sup><br><sup>The stress of having to deal with them must be quite burdensome for young Liese.</sup></p>
<p id="L207"><br></p>
<p id="L208">"This is what a lord's daughter is like. There's no way you can fall in love and get married properly."<br><sup>「領主の娘なんてこんなものでしょ。まともに恋愛して結婚なんて、できるわけがないよ」</sup><br><sup>"This is what a lord's daughter looks like.It's impossible to fall in love and get married."</sup></p>
<p id="L209"><br></p>
<p id="L210">As Liese said this, she turned her attention to the river and popped the food into her mouth.<br><sup>リーゼはそう言いながら、川に目を向けてぱくぱくと料理を口に運んでいる。</sup><br><sup>As Liese spoke, she turned to the river and carried the food to her mouth.</sup></p>
<p id="L211">Ichiran felt a sense of loneliness when he saw Lise's seeming mastery of the situation.<br><sup>達観しているような様子のリーゼに、一良は何とも寂しい気持ちになった。</sup><br><sup>Ichira felt very lonely when Liese looked optimistic.</sup></p>
<p id="L212"><br></p>
<p id="L213">I get a lot of money from the people who come on to me, so I sell it to eat good food and buy beautiful clothes. I don't think it's wrong for me to do that.<br><sup>「その分言い寄ってくるやつらから色々貰えるから、それを売って美味しいもの食べたり綺麗な服買ったりしてるんだけどね。それくらいやっても、バチはあたらないでしょ」</sup><br><sup>"I can get a lot of things from the people who come up to me, so I sell them and eat delicious food and buy beautiful clothes.Even if you do that much, you won't get hit by a bee."</sup></p>
<p id="L214"><br></p>
<p id="L215">I see. So you're playing around with the money from the gift sales to relieve the stress of the visitation.<br><sup>「なるほど、贈り物を売ったお金で遊び歩いてるのは、面会のストレス発散なわけか」</sup><br><sup>"Well, is it to relieve the stress of visiting people that they spend money on selling gifts?"</sup></p>
<p id="L216"><br></p>
<p id="L217">"Yeah."<br><sup>「うん」</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L218"><br></p>
<p id="L219">But if you're getting so many visitors, couldn't you have found one or two that looked good?"<br><sup>「でも、そんなに沢山面会者が来るなら、１人や２人よさそうなのはいなかったのか？」</sup><br><sup>"But if there were so many visitors, was there no one or two who looked good?"</sup></p>
<p id="L220"><br></p>
<p id="L221">If I had ......, I'd be married by now."<br><sup>「……いたらとっくに結婚してるよね」</sup><br><sup>"...you're married a long time ago, aren't you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L222"><br></p>
<p id="L223">...... So be it."<br><sup>「……それもそうか」</sup><br><sup>"...that's true,"</sup></p>
<p id="L224"><br></p>
<p id="L225">Liese stopped eating and looked at Ichiran with a jittery look in her eyes.<br><sup>リーゼは食事の手を止めて、ジト目で一良に目を向ける。</sup><br><sup>Liese stops eating and looks at Ichira with her eyes.</sup></p>
<p id="L226">Then he placed the bread he was holding on the mattress and said, "Oh no," and returned his gaze to the river.<br><sup>そして持っていたパンを敷き布に置くと、「あーあ」と言って視線を川に戻した。</sup><br><sup>Then, when I put the bread I had on the mat, I said, "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</sup></p>

<p id="L228">I thought I'd finally found the right guy. I thought I'd finally found the right guy, but he's going to hate me with all his might, and I don't know what I'm going to do now."<br><sup>「やっといい人見つけたと思ったんだけどな。その人には思いっきり嫌われちゃうし、もうこれからどうすればいいんだろ」</sup><br><sup>"I thought I had finally found a good man.He hates me as much as he can, and what should I do now?"</sup></p>
<p id="L229"><br></p>
<p id="L230">No, I don't hate you.<br><sup>「いや、別に嫌ってはいないって」</sup><br><sup>"No, I don't hate it,"</sup></p>
<p id="L231"><br></p>
<p id="L232">Really?<br><sup>「本当？」</sup><br><sup>"Really?"</sup></p>
<p id="L233"><br></p>

<p id="L242">Ichiran laughed a little at Lise's puffed out cheeks.<br><sup>頬を膨らませているリーゼに、一良は少し笑ってしまった。</sup><br><sup>Ichira laughed a little at Liese, who was bulging her cheeks.</sup></p>
<p id="L243">Lise was probably joking around a bit, concerned about the testy atmosphere.<br><sup>辛気臭くなってきた雰囲気を気遣って、リーゼは少しふざけてみせたのだろう。</sup><br><sup>Liese must have been a little playful, worrying about the atmosphere.</sup></p>

<p id="L256">She was about to say that much when Lise remembered how Zirconia had left her.<br><sup>そこまで言いかけて、リーゼはジルコニアが去って行った時の様子を思い出した。</sup><br><sup>At that point, Liese remembered how zirconia had left.</sup></p>
<p id="L257">Zirconia went into the forest alone, without taking anyone with her.<br><sup>ジルコニアは、誰も連れずに１人で森へ入っていった。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia went into the forest alone with no one.</sup></p>
<p id="L258">In other words, Zirconia is now alone in this dark forest.<br><sup>つまり、今ジルコニアはこの暗い森の中を１人きりでいるのだ。</sup><br><sup>In other words, zirconia is now alone in this dark forest.</sup></p>
<p id="L259">Wandering alone in the mountains at night, when wild beasts may appear, is an extremely dangerous thing to do.<br><sup>野生の獣が出るかもしれない夜の山を１人で歩き回るなど、危険極まりない行為だ。</sup><br><sup>It is dangerous to walk alone in the mountains at night, where wild animals may appear.</sup></p>

<p id="L261">(Why would you do something so dangerous ......?)"<br><sup>「（どうしてそんな危険なことを……あ）」</sup><br><sup>"(Why are you doing such a dangerous thing... oh)"</sup></p>
<p id="L262"><br></p>
<p id="L263">"...... escort, you're not following me, are you? Let's hurry up and pick him up. Something might have happened."<br><sup>「……護衛、付いていってないよな。急いで迎えにいこう。何かあったのかもしれない」</sup><br><sup>"... you didn't follow me, did you?Let's hurry up and pick him up.Something may have happened."</sup></p>
<p id="L264"><br></p>
<p id="L265">Wait.<br><sup>「待って」</sup><br><sup>"Wait a minute,"</sup></p>
<p id="L266"><br></p>
<p id="L267">Ichiran stood up hurriedly, but Lise grabbed his arm and held him back.<br><sup>慌てて立ち上がった一良の腕を、リーゼは掴んで引き止めた。</sup><br><sup>Liese grabbed Ichira's arm and held him back.</sup></p>
<p id="L268"><br></p>
<p id="L269">Let's just wait a little longer, okay?"<br><sup>「もう少しだけ、待ってみよう？」</sup><br><sup>"Shall we wait a little longer?"</sup></p>
<p id="L270"><br></p>
<p id="L271">No, we should go get him right away. If anything happens to you, you'll never get it back."<br><sup>「いや、すぐに迎えに行くべきだろ。何かあったら取り返しがつかないぞ」</sup><br><sup>"No, I ought to pick you up at once.If anything happens, there's no turning back."</sup></p>

<p id="L277">"Yeah."<br><sup>「うん」</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L278"><br></p>
<p id="L279">Lise nodded to Kazuyoshi, who looked at her with a puzzled expression.<br><sup>いぶかしむような表情をする一良に、リーゼは頷いた。</sup><br><sup>Liese nodded to Ichira, who looked suspicious.</sup></p>
<p id="L280"><br></p>
<p id="L281">"Because no one has lived here for a long time now, right?　The village up ahead is also abandoned. ......"<br><sup>「だって、ここにはもうずっと前から誰も住んでないんだろ？　この先にある村も廃村だって……」</sup><br><sup>"Because no one has lived here for a long time, has it?"The village ahead is also abandoned..."</sup></p>

<p id="L283">About ten years ago, there was an incident in which several villages around here were attacked by thieves, and the residents were all killed.<br><sup>「10年くらい前に、このあたりの村がいくつか野盗に襲われて、住民が皆殺しにされる事件があったの」</sup><br><sup>"About 10 years ago, several villages around here were attacked by thieves and all the residents were killed."</sup></p>

<p id="L287">"Killing everyone is ...... then Mr. Zirconia is ......"<br><sup>「皆殺しって……じゃあ、ジルコニアさんは……」</sup><br><sup>"Killing them all... Then Mr. Zirconia..."</sup></p>

<p id="L289">"Yes. Maybe he's a survivor from that village."<br><sup>「うん。たぶん、その村の生き残りなんだと思う」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I think it's probably the survival of the village."</sup></p>
<p id="L290"><br></p>
<p id="L291">Liese said, and squinted at the dark forest beast path Zirconia had walked down.<br><sup>リーゼはそう言うと、ジルコニアが歩いていった暗い森の獣道を見つめて目を細めた。</sup><br><sup>said Liese, squinting at the dark forest animal path on which Zirconia had walked.</sup></p>
<p id="L292"><br></p>
<p id="L293">So let's just wait a little longer, okay?"<br><sup>「だから、もう少しだけ、待ってみよう？」</sup><br><sup>"So, shall we wait a little longer?"</sup></p>
<p id="L294"><br></p>
<p id="L295">"...... Got it."<br><sup>「……分かった」</sup><br><sup>"...okay,"</sup></p>

<p id="L301">At the same time, Zirconia was sitting in front of three graves that were piled high with earth and stones, looking at the moon.<br><sup>その頃、ジルコニアはこんもりと土が盛られて石が積まれた３つの墓の前に座り、月を眺めていた。</sup><br><sup>At that time, Zirconia sat in front of three tombs filled with earth and stones, looking at the moon.</sup></p>
