<p id="L1">The last night of the year was just around the corner, and the city of Isteria, tinged with the colors of the setting sun, was filled with a somewhat buoyant atmosphere.<br><sup>今年最後の夜を目前に控え、夕焼け色に染まるイステリアの街はどことなく浮かれた雰囲気に包まれていた。</sup><br><sup>With the last night of the year just around the corner, the sunset-colored streets were somehow filled with excitement.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">The streets were overflowing with people, and the commercial district was so overcrowded that it was difficult to walk around, a veritable battlefield.<br><sup>通りは人であふれ、商業区画にいたっては歩くのにも難儀するほどの過密具合でまさに戦場だ。</sup><br><sup>The streets are so crowded that it's hard to walk in commercial areas that it's a battlefield.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">In a room of Narson's mansion, somewhat far from such a place, the air was far from that of a citizen.<br><sup>そんな場所からやや離れたナルソン邸の一室では、市民のそれとはかけ離れた空気に包まれていた。</sup><br><sup>A room in Naruson's house, a little far from such a place, was surrounded by a distant atmosphere from that of the citizens.</sup></p>
<p id="L4"><br></p>
<p id="L5">"Oh, you're so busy with your own business that you didn't call me back?"<br><sup>「ほう、自分のところだけで手一杯で、連絡するのが遅れたと申すか」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I'm afraid I'm late in contacting you because I'm too busy with myself."</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">An old man with white hair and a white beard, sitting deep on a sofa in the guest room, says in a questioning tone to Narson sitting in front of him.<br><sup>来賓室のソファーに深く腰を下ろした白髪白髭の老人が、正面に座るナルソンに詰問するような口調で言う。</sup><br><sup>The gray-haired, white-bearded old man sitting deep on the sofa in the guest room asked Naruson, who was sitting in front of him.</sup></p>
<p id="L8">The old man's name is Elmire Arcadian. He is the current king of this country.<br><sup>老人の名はエルミア・アルカディアン。この国の現国王だ。</sup><br><sup>The old man's name is Hermia Arcadian.He is the present king of this country.</sup></p>
<p id="L9">Although he is already over 70 years old, he still continues to be the king without retiring from active service.<br><sup>歳はすでに70を超えているが、未だに現役を退かずに国王を続けている。</sup><br><sup>Although he is over 70 years old, he still remains king.</sup></p>
<p id="L10">Next to him, a man with bad eyesight is looking around the room with a bored look in his eyes.<br><sup>その隣では、目付きの悪い男が退屈そうに部屋を見渡している。</sup><br><sup>Next door, a man with bad eyes looked bored into the room.</sup></p>
<p id="L11">He is the first prince and his name is Le Gro. He is 28 years old and is married. He has four children already.<br><sup>彼は第一王子であり、名前はルグロ。歳は28で既婚。子供もすでに４人いる。</sup><br><sup>He is the first prince and his name is Luglo.Married at 28.I already have four children.</sup></p>
<p id="L12">To the left and right of the three seated facing each other sat Dias Gregorn, Lord of the Lordship of Gregorn, and Hayshel Fleiss, Lord of Fleiss.<br><sup>向かい合って座る３人の左右には、グレゴルン領領主であるダイアス・グレゴルンと、フライス領領主のヘイシェル・フライスが座っている。</sup><br><sup>On the left and right sides of the three people sitting opposite each other are Diaz Gregorne, the lord of Gregorne, and Herschel Milling, the lord of Milling.</sup></p>
<p id="L13">Díaz is 45 years old and has a calm appearance with an impressive kaiser beard around his mouth.<br><sup>ダイアスは歳は45で、口元にはやしたカイゼル髭が印象的な、落ち着いた風貌の男だ。</sup><br><sup>Diaz is 45 years old and has a calm appearance with a Kaiser beard growing near his mouth.</sup></p>
<p id="L14">Heyshel is just over 60 years old. He is an elderly gentleman with a large physique, a smooth head, and a soft expression.<br><sup>ヘイシェルは歳は60ちょうど。大柄な体躯につるつるの頭、柔和な表情がよく似合う老紳士である。</sup><br><sup>Herschel is sixty years old.He is an old gentleman with a large body, a smooth head, and a soft expression.</sup></p>
<p id="L15">She is married but has not been blessed with children and has not adopted any.<br><sup>結婚はしているが子供に恵まれず、養子も取っていない。</sup><br><sup>Married, but not blessed with children and adopted children.</sup></p>
<p id="L16">The question of what to do about the successor has often been raised in the territory, but even the direction has not been decided yet.<br><sup>後継者をどうするかという問題が領内ではたびたび持ち上がっているが、未だに方向性すら決まっていない。</sup><br><sup>The question of what to do with the successor has often been raised in the territory, but the direction has yet to be decided.</sup></p>
<p id="L17"><br></p>
<p id="L18">"Yes. It was a series of new attempts, and we couldn't keep in touch with each territory. We didn't even have a prototype of any of the tools.<br><sup>「はい。新しい試みの連続で、逐次各領地に連絡というわけにもいきませんでした。どの道具も試作にすらこぎつけていない状態でしたので」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I couldn't contact each territory one after another in succession of new attempts.None of the tools had even been worked on for trial."</sup></p>
<p id="L19"><br></p>
<p id="L20">"The territory is quite developed for such a young man."<br><sup>「にしては、ずいぶんと領内は発展しているではないか」</sup><br><sup>"The territory has developed considerably, hasn't it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L21"><br></p>
<p id="L22">"This is due to the rapid improvement in the food situation. The new tools have also allowed us to mine more."<br><sup>「食糧事情が急改善した影響です。新しい道具のおかげで、鉱山の採掘量が増えたという理由もあります」</sup><br><sup>"It's the impact of a sharp improvement in the food situation.Another reason is that the new tools have increased the mining capacity."</sup></p>
<p id="L23"><br></p>
<p id="L24">"Oh, I think it's called a hand pump. I've been hearing about it.<br><sup>「ああ、確か手押しポンプとかいったか。私の耳にも入ってきておるぞ」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, if I remember correctly, a hand pump or something like that.It's in my ear, too."</sup></p>
<p id="L25"><br></p>
<p id="L26">King Elmire says, staring at Narson's face as if to check his reaction.<br><sup>反応を確かめるように、エルミア国王はナルソンの顔を凝視して言う。</sup><br><sup>King Hermia said, staring Narson in the face, as if to confirm his reaction.</sup></p>
<p id="L27">Narson didn't seem particularly perturbed and smiled, "You know me well.<br><sup>ナルソンは特に動じた様子もなく、「よくご存知で」と微笑んで見せた。</sup><br><sup>Naruson showed no sign of agitation and smiled, saying, "I know you very well."</sup></p>
<p id="L28">The reason was that Narson had received information beforehand that they knew of the existence of the hand pumps.<br><sup>手押しポンプの存在を彼らが知っているという情報を、ナルソンは事前に得ていたからだ。</sup><br><sup>Naruson had already obtained information that they knew the existence of a hand pump.</sup></p>
<p id="L29"><br></p>
<p id="L30">"Yes. Thanks to this tool, mines can now be drained. Old mines have been collapsed by pouring stored water into them, and the remaining ore has been recovered.<br><sup>「はい。その道具のおかげで、鉱山では排水が行えるようになりました。古い鉱山は貯めた水を流し込んで崩落させ、残っていた鉱石を回収したりもしております」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, because of that tool, we can drain the mines.Old mines pour stored water into them and cause them to collapse, and even recover the remaining ore."</sup></p>
<p id="L31"><br></p>
<p id="L32">"Are those tools here?"<br><sup>「その道具はここにあるのか？」</sup><br><sup>"Is this the tool?"</sup></p>
<p id="L33"><br></p>
<p id="L34">"Yes, sir. Would you like to see it?"<br><sup>「ございます。ごらんになられますか？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes. Would you like to see it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L35"><br></p>
<p id="L36">"Mmm. Please bring the blueprints with you. I've brought a number of craftsmen from King's Landing with me, so please teach them how to make it."<br><sup>「うむ。設計図も一緒に頼む。王都の職人を何人も連れて来ているから、その者らに作り方を教えてやってくれ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I'd like a blueprint, too.I've brought in a number of craftsmen from the royal capital, so teach them how to make it."</sup></p>
<p id="L37"><br></p>
<p id="L38">"Very well, sir. Are you sure you want to draw up a contract after the banquet regarding the payment for the technology? I'm hoping it will be in the same format as our last transaction.<br><sup>「かしこまりました。技術提供の代金に関しましては、宴の後で契約書を作成するということでよろしいでしょうか。前回の取引と同様の形式にできればと思うのですが」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, sir.As for the cost of providing technology, do you mean that I will draw up a contract after the banquet?I wish I could use the same format as the last transaction."</sup></p>
<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">"Mr. Narson, I think you've got it all wrong."<br><sup>「ナルソンさんよ、あんた少し勘違いしてるんじゃねえの？」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Narson, aren't you a little mistaken?"</sup></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42">As soon as Narson replied, Le Gro, who had been looking bored until then, opened his mouth.<br><sup>ナルソンが答えると同時に、それまで退屈そうにしていたルグロが口を開いた。</sup><br><sup>As soon as Narson answered, Luglo, who had been bored until then, spoke.</sup></p>
<p id="L43"><br></p>
<p id="L44">"You know, before, the spinning thing that pumps water out of the ...... Uh, what was it?<br><sup>「前にさ、水を汲み上げるぐるぐる回るやつ……ええと、なんだっけ？」</sup><br><sup>"Before, the one that pumps up and around... well, what was it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L45"><br></p>
<p id="L46">"Is that a waterwheel?"<br><sup>「水車ですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Waterwheel?"</sup></p>
<p id="L47"><br></p>
<p id="L48">"Yes, that. I thought about it when I heard about the waterwheel, but can't we show more cooperation among our friends?　We all fought together as one in the war four years ago. I think it's wrong to forget that and try to get money from our friends.<br><sup>「そう、それ。その水車の話を聞いた時も思ったんだけどさ、仲間同士もっと協力しようって姿勢を見せられないわけ？　４年前の戦争では皆が一丸となって戦ったんだからさ。それを忘れて仲間から金とろうってのはどうかと思うわけよ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, that's it. I thought when I heard about the waterwheel, but can't you show your willingness to cooperate more with each other?We all fought as one in the war four years ago.Why don't you forget that and take money from your friends?"</sup></p>
<p id="L49"><br></p>
<p id="L50">Narson sighed inwardly as Le Gro lectured him in a rude tone.<br><sup>ぞんざいな口調で講釈をたれるルグロに、ナルソンは内心ため息をついた。</sup><br><sup>Naruson sighed inwardly at Lugro, who gave a rude speech.</sup></p>
<p id="L51">The current king, Elmire, is an excellent ruler, skilled at diplomatic negotiations and controlling the nobility, as well as managing his territory reasonably well and making decisions in times of war.<br><sup>現国王であるエルミアは外交交渉や貴族の掌握に長け、領地運営もそこそこ上手く戦時の決断力もあり、統治者としては優秀な部類に入る。</sup><br><sup>The present king, Hermia, is a good diplomat and aristocrat, has reasonably good territorial management and wartime determination, and is among the best rulers.</sup></p>
<p id="L52">However, his son, the first prince Le Gro, is a "bad boy" in Narson's opinion, as he doesn't think things through and doesn't speak up, or follows his emotions at the time.<br><sup>だが、その息子である第一王子ルグロは、物事を深く考えて発言しないというか、その時の感情に従う性格というか、ナルソンに言わせれば『ダメな子』なのである。</sup><br><sup>But his son, Prince Lugro, is not a thoughtful person, or a person who follows the feelings of the time, or, in Narson's words, a 'bad boy.'</sup></p>
<p id="L53">The king was very lenient with Le Gro, a late single seed, and let him do whatever he wanted without getting angry, only praising him.<br><sup>国王は遅くにできた一粒種であるルグロに対して甘々で、褒めることばかりで怒ることをせずに好き勝手にやらせていた。</sup><br><sup>The king was indulgent with Luglo, a late-ripening species, and was always complimenting and letting him do whatever he wanted without getting angry.</sup></p>
<p id="L54">Perhaps because of this, he has never shown any interest in studying, and his knowledge is at the bottom of the heap because no one forced him to, as the King of Elmere wanted his son to grow up freely.<br><sup>そのためか、彼は勉学にはまったく興味を示さず、『息子にはのびのびと育って欲しい』というエルミア国王の意向で誰も強制しなかったため、知識力は地の底だ。</sup><br><sup>Perhaps that's why he was not interested in studying at all, and his knowledge was at the bottom of the earth because he didn't force anyone to do so in the wish of King Hermia, who wanted his son to grow up at ease.</sup></p>
<p id="L55">When he was young, he had a parade of problematic behaviors, such as wandering around the city on his own with the delinquent sons of aristocrats, or getting into a brawl with a civilian at a tavern.<br><sup>若い頃は貴族の不良息子たちと勝手に市街をぶらついたり、場末の酒場で一般市民と乱闘騒ぎを起こしたりと問題行動のオンパレードだった。</sup><br><sup>When he was young, he used to wander around the streets with his sons, who were nobles, or make a scene with ordinary citizens in a bar near the corner.</sup></p>
<p id="L56">Since his marriage, his problematic behavior has decreased, but his thug-like personality has not changed.<br><sup>結婚してからは問題行動はなりをひそめているが、チンピラのような性格は変わっていない。</sup><br><sup>After marriage, the problematic behavior disappeared, but his personality remained the same.</sup></p>
<p id="L57">If there was one good thing about him, it was that he was a very loving wife, which was unusual for a powerful man in King's Landing.<br><sup>彼に１ついいところがあるとすれば、王都の権力者には珍しく超愛妻家だということだろう。</sup><br><sup>One good thing about him is that he is a wife-lover, which is rare for powerful people in the royal capital.</sup></p>
<p id="L58">He does not have any concubines or side chambers, and is still very much in love with Her Highness.<br><sup>妾や側室を一切持たず、妃殿下にベタ惚れで今もラブラブである。</sup><br><sup>She has no concubine or concubine, and is still in love with her princess.</sup></p>
<p id="L59"><br></p>
<p id="L60">"Mr. Le Gro, that's not true. Technological development is a very labor-intensive process, and those who develop it should be paid accordingly.<br><sup>「ルグロ様、それは違います。技術開発というものは非常に労力のかかるものでして、開発した者には相応の対価が支払われるべきなのです」</sup><br><sup>"That's not true, Mr. Lugro.Technology development is very labor-intensive, and those who develop it should be paid a reasonable price."</sup></p>
<p id="L61"><br></p>
<p id="L62">"I know, I know, I know. But we're all friends, right?　Then we don't need the money. Since we're all friends, why don't we just cooperate with each other?<br><sup>「んなことは分かってるよ。でもさ、俺たち皆仲間だよな？　それなら金なんていらねえだろ。仲間なんだから協力し合えばいいじゃねえか」</sup><br><sup>"I know what it is,"But we're all friends, aren't we?Then you don't need money, do you?We're friends, so why don't we cooperate?"</sup></p>
<p id="L63"><br></p>
<p id="L64">"No, that's not what I meant. No matter how good the product is, if the technology is taken for free, the motivation to work on technological development will wane. It will have a negative impact on the development of the next technology.<br><sup>「いえ、そうではなくてですね。いくら優れたものを作ってもタダで技術をとられてしまうとなっては、技術開発に取り組む意欲が薄れてしまいます。次からの技術開発に悪影響が出るのですよ」</sup><br><sup>"No, that's not the case.No matter how good you make it, if you take away your technology for free, you will lose your motivation to develop it.It will adversely affect the development of technology from next time on."</sup></p>
<p id="L65"><br></p>
<p id="L66">"I know, I know, I know. "I know that, but we're friends, right?　We should be working together, right?"<br><sup>「だから、んなことは分かってるんだって。でもさ、俺たち仲間じゃん？　だったら協力し合うべきだろ？」</sup><br><sup>"That's why I know that.But we're friends, aren't we?"Then we should cooperate, right?"</sup></p>
<p id="L67"><br></p>
<p id="L68">"No, no, that's why. ......"<br><sup>「い、いえ、だからですね……」</sup><br><sup>"No, no, that's why..."</sup></p>
<p id="L69"><br></p>
<p id="L70">When Narson was despairing that this guy couldn't understand a word he was saying, Dias stopped him from the side and said, "Well, well.<br><sup>駄目だこいつは言葉が通じない、とナルソンが絶望していると、横からダイアスが「まあまあ」と止めに入ってくれた。</sup><br><sup>When Narson was despairing that he couldn't make himself understood, Diaz came in from the side and said, "So-so."</sup></p>
<p id="L71">The King of Elmire sipped his tea without a care in the world.<br><sup>エルミア国王はそ知らぬ顔でお茶を啜っている。</sup><br><sup>King Hermia is sipping tea unconsciously.</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">"I'm sure we both have some things we can't compromise on, but let's leave that for another time and get on with it. Mr. Naluson, can you tell us more about the 'iron' that you contacted me about the other day?"<br><sup>「お互い譲れないことろがあるとは思いますが、この話はまた後日ということにして、とりあえず話を進めましょう。ナルソン殿、先日連絡のあった『鉄』について詳しくお聞かせいただけますか？」</sup><br><sup>"I'm sure we can't give in to each other, but let's talk about this at a later date and move on.Mr. Narson, could you tell me more about the 'iron' you contacted me about the other day?"</sup></p>
<p id="L74"><br></p>
<p id="L75">"Oh, oh, yes. Then let's take care of that first. Master Le Gro, may I?"<br><sup>「お、おお、そうですな。では先にそちらの話を片付けましょう。ルグロ様、よろしいでしょうか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, oh, yes.Well, let's get this over with first.Mr. Lugro, may I?"</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">"Hmm?　Yeah, I don't mind, but... Let's just have more camaraderie, okay?"<br><sup>「ん？　ああ、別にいいけどよ。もっと仲間意識持とうぜ？」</sup><br><sup>"Huh? Oh, I don't mind.Let's have more sense of fellowship."</sup></p>
<p id="L78"><br></p>
<p id="L79">"Yes, sir. As you may already know, I would like to explain once again about the newly discovered iron in our territory. It's a revolutionary material that will replace bronze ware. ......"<br><sup>「は、はい。では、すでにご存知かとは思いますが、我が領で新たに発見された鉄というものについて今一度説明させていただきます。これは青銅器に代わる画期的な材料でして……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, yes, then, as you may already know, I would like to once again explain the newly discovered iron in our territory.This is an epoch-making alternative to bronze."</sup></p>
<p id="L80"><br></p>
<p id="L81">Trying not to focus on Le Gro, Narson began to explain about the ironware.<br><sup>なるべく意識をルグロに向けないようにしながら、ナルソンは鉄器についての説明を始める。</sup><br><sup>Naruson begins to explain ironware, trying to keep his consciousness as low as possible.</sup></p>
<p id="L82">I finished my explanation and also explained that Balbert was probably making ironware.<br><sup>そうしてひととおりの説明を終え、バルベールが鉄器を作っているだろうことも合わせて説明した。</sup><br><sup>So he finished his explanation, and explained to them that Valve was making ironware.</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">"Hmm, I heard that Balbert is making ironware. I see. So iron was behind the massive military reform."<br><sup>「ふむ、鉄器をバルベールが作っているとな。なるほど、大規模な軍制改革の背景には鉄の存在があったわけか」</sup><br><sup>"Well, Balvert is making iron.Indeed, was there iron behind the massive military reform?"</sup></p>
<p id="L85"><br></p>
<p id="L86">Narson nodded to the king, who snorted with a grim expression.<br><sup>険しい表情で唸る国王に、ナルソンは頷く。</sup><br><sup>Naruson nods to the king, who groans grimly.</sup></p>
<p id="L87"><br></p>
<p id="L88">"Yes. Therefore, we must manufacture ironware as soon as possible. The methods of mining and processing iron have already been established by our craftsmen. We will provide you with the information free of charge, and we would like you to work on mining and manufacturing in various places."<br><sup>「はい。なので、我々も速やかに鉄器を製造しなければなりません。鉄の採掘方法と加工方法はすでに我が領の職人が確立済みです。情報は無償で提供いたしますので、各地で採掘と製造に取り組んでいただきたいのです」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, so we have to make ironware as soon as well.The method of iron mining and processing has been established by our craftsmen.Information will be provided free of charge, so we want you to work on mining and manufacturing everywhere."</sup></p>
<p id="L89"><br></p>
<p id="L90">"Oh, that's it, that's it. You're starting to get it, Mr. Narson.<br><sup>「お、それだよそれ。ナルソンさん分かってきたじゃん」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that's it.Narson, you're starting to understand."</sup></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">"Oh, thank you."<br><sup>「あ、ありがとうございます」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, thank you very much,"</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94">Narson smiles at Le Gro, who shakes his thumb and says with satisfaction.<br><sup>立てた親指を揺らしながら満足げに言うルグロに対し、ナルソンが引きつった笑みを浮かべる。</sup><br><sup>Naruson smiles at Lugro, who says with satisfaction, shaking his raised thumb.</sup></p>
<p id="L95"><br></p>
<p id="L96">"Narson, you can hardly mine iron ore in my territory, which is full of plains. I would like to ask you to sell me the ironware you have produced."<br><sup>「ナルソン、平地ばかりの我が領では鉄鉱石はほとんど採掘できないだろう。出来上がった鉄器を売ってもらうかたちをお願いしたいのだが」</sup><br><sup>"Narson, in my flat land, little iron ore will be mined.I'd like you to sell me the finished iron."</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">Narson nodded quickly at Haychell's offer.<br><sup>ヘイシェルの申し出に、ナルソンはすぐに頷いた。</sup><br><sup>Narson nodded at Herschel's offer.</sup></p>
<p id="L99"><br></p>
<p id="L100">"Of course. But we have a serious shortage of craftsmen here, and I'm worried about our production capacity. If you don't mind, I'd like to borrow a craftsman.<br><sup>「もちろんだ。だが、こっちは深刻な職人不足で生産力に不安があってな。よければ職人を貸してもらいたいのだが」</sup><br><sup>"Of course, but I'm worried about my productivity due to a serious shortage of craftsmen.If you don't mind, I'd like you to lend me a craftsman."</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">"All right. When we get back, we'll make some adjustments and send you out right away."<br><sup>「分かった。戻ったら調整を行ってすぐに送り出そう」</sup><br><sup>"Okay, let's make adjustments and send them off as soon as we get back."</sup></p>
<p id="L103"><br></p>
<p id="L104">"I'm sorry, that's very kind of you. I'll try to get you some ironware as soon as I can."<br><sup>「すまん、助かる。可能な限り早く鉄器を融通できるよう努力する」</sup><br><sup>"I'm sorry, I'm saved.I will try to accommodate the iron as soon as possible."</sup></p>
<p id="L105"><br></p>
<p id="L106">"If possible, I'd like to replace the artisans at regular intervals so that we can quickly improve the skills of the artisans in Millington. And if you can send us ore at a reasonable price, we can handle the refining ourselves."<br><sup>「出来れば一定期間ごとに職人を入れ替えて、フライス領の職人の技術力を早く向上させたい。鉱石も安く送ってもらえるなら、精製も自分たちで何とかしよう」</sup><br><sup>"If possible, I would like to replace the craftsmen every certain period of time and improve the technical skills of the milling craftsmen as soon as possible.If you can send the ore cheaply, we'll do something about the refining ourselves."</sup></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">"I'll send a few craftsmen to teach you the techniques. And leave the ore supply to me."<br><sup>「ならば、折をみてこちらからも技術指導の職人を何名か派遣することにしよう。鉱石の供給も任せておいてくれ」</sup><br><sup>"Then, at the right time, I will send some technical instructors.Leave the supply of ore to me."</sup></p>
<p id="L109"><br></p>
<p id="L110">"As well as the ironware, may I also tell you about the recent developments in Balbert?"<br><sup>「鉄器もそうですが、最近のバルベールの様子についてもお話してよろしいかな？」</sup><br><sup>"As with ironware, may I tell you about Valve's recent appearance?"</sup></p>
<p id="L111"><br></p>
<p id="L112">Dias, who had been listening in silence, opened his mouth with a serious expression.<br><sup>黙って話を聞いていたダイアスが、深刻そうな表情で口を開いた。</sup><br><sup>Diaz, who listened silently, spoke with a serious expression.</sup></p>
<p id="L113"><br></p>

<p id="L116">Daileass nodded in response to King Elmire's question.<br><sup>エルミア国王の問いに、ダイアスが頷く。</sup><br><sup>Diaz nods at King Hermia's question.</sup></p>
<p id="L117"><br></p>
<p id="L118">"Yes. As you know, Balbert has recently begun to deploy his army in a way that seems to be staring at our borders, but it seems that things are not only happening on land. We have received information that a large number of warships are being built in the city of Balbert, not far from our territory.<br><sup>「はい。近頃、バルベールは我が国の国境線を睨むようなかたちで軍団を配置し始めているのは知ってのとおりですが、ことは陸地ばかりで起きているわけではないようです。我が領からほどないバルベールの街で、大量の軍船が建造されているとの情報が入ってきました」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, we know that Barbert has recently begun to deploy his legions in a way that glares at our borders, but it doesn't seem that this is happening only on land.Information has come in that a large number of warships are being built in the city of Valve, not far from our territory."</sup></p>

<p id="L120">"Hmm, warships. Is there that many of them?"<br><sup>「む、軍船か。それほどに多いのか？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, a warship? Is that so many?"</sup></p>

<p id="L124">Most of the military ships used in this world are galleys, which are flat structures with two masts.<br><sup>この世界で用いられている軍船は、２本のマストを備えた平べったい構造のガレー船が主流である。</sup><br><sup>Most of the military ships used in this world are flat-structured galleys with two masts.</sup></p>
<p id="L125">A galley is a military boat that is rowed by many people using oars to move the boat.<br><sup>ガレー船とは、多人数でオールを漕いで舟を動かす軍船だ。</sup><br><sup>A galley is a military ship that paddles oars in large numbers.</sup></p>
<p id="L126">The way to fight is quite simple: approach the opponent's warship, board it, and subdue it in a white-knuckle battle.<br><sup>戦い方は至極単純で、相手の軍船に接近して乗り込み、白兵戦で制圧するのだ。</sup><br><sup>The way to fight is very simple, approaching the opponent's ship and conquering it in a white battle.</sup></p>
<p id="L127">Other than that, the only other method of warfare is a long-distance attack using ranged weapons such as bows and arrows or slings.<br><sup>それ以外の戦法となると、弓矢やスリングなどの射撃武器を用いた遠距離攻撃のみとなる。</sup><br><sup>Other tactics include long-range attacks using shooting weapons such as bow and arrow and sling.</sup></p>

<p id="L130"><br></p>
<p id="L131">"We fought well in the last naval battle with the help of our neighbors, the Krayrats, but if we continue to sit on our hands, we may be in danger next time. We need bigger ships."<br><sup>「前回の海戦は隣国クレイラッツの援軍もあって我々は善戦しましたが、このまま手をこまねいていては次は危ういかもしれません。我々にも大型船が必要です」</sup><br><sup>"The last naval battle was fought well with the aid of neighboring Clairats, but if we continue to do so, we may be in danger next time.We need a big ship, too."</sup></p>
<p id="L132"><br></p>
<p id="L133">"Hmm, ...... must get right on that.<br><sup>「うむ……すぐに取り掛からねばならないか」</sup><br><sup>"Well... do we have to get started right away?"</sup></p>
<p id="L134"><br></p>
<p id="L135">Daileass nodded to King Elmire, who snorted with a serious face.<br><sup>深刻な面持ちで唸るエルミア国王に、ダイアスが頷く。</sup><br><sup>Diaz nods to King Hermia, who groans gravely.</sup></p>
<p id="L136"><br></p>
<p id="L137">"Yes. I have a request to make to you. I would like to ask you all to provide our territory with materials and funds to expand our naval capabilities.<br><sup>「はい。そこで、皆様に私からお願いがあります。海軍力増強のため、資材と資金を我が領に提供していただきたいのです」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, so I have a favor to ask of you.We would like you to provide our territory with materials and funds to build up our naval capabilities."</sup></p>
<p id="L138"><br></p>
<p id="L139">"It would be better to gather all the craftsmen in the capital and concentrate on the task at hand. Frye's territory is next door, and it's cheaper to transport goods there."<br><sup>「それならば王都に職人を集めて集中して取り掛かったほうがよかろう。フライス領は隣だし、物資の輸送も安く済む」</sup><br><sup>"Then it would be better to gather the craftsmen in the royal capital and concentrate on them.The milling area is next door, and the transportation of supplies is cheap."</sup></p>
<p id="L140"><br></p>
<p id="L141">"It's true, but the main battlefield for the naval battle will be in Gregorian territory, which borders Balbert. Whether it's building shipbuilding facilities or training craftsmen, it would be more appropriate to do it in our territory."<br><sup>「それはそうですが、海戦の主戦場となるのはバルベールと国境を接している我がグレゴルン領です。造船設備を整えるにしろ、職人を育てるにしろ、我が領で行ったほうが適切でしょう」</sup><br><sup>"That is true, but the main battlefield of the naval battle is our Gregorian territory, which borders Valver.Whether it's building a ship or training a craftsman, it's more appropriate to do it in our territory."</sup></p>

<p id="L143">"Hmm. ......"<br><sup>「ふむ……」</sup><br><sup>"Well..."</sup></p>
<p id="L144"><br></p>
<p id="L145">With a glance at the pondering King Elmire, Daileass turned to Narson.<br><sup>思案しているエルミア国王を一瞥すると、ダイアスはナルソンに顔を向けた。</sup><br><sup>When he glanced at King Hermia, who was contemplating, Diaz turned to Narson.</sup></p>
<p id="L146"><br></p>
<p id="L147">"Lord Narson, I've heard that the Isthmus possesses many excellent craftsmen, could you lend me some of them?"<br><sup>「ナルソン殿、イステール領は優秀な職人を多数保有していると聞いているが、その者たちを貸してはいただけないだろうか？」</sup><br><sup>"Dear Narson, I've heard that the Istair domain has many excellent craftsmen, but could you lend them to me?"</sup></p>
<p id="L148"><br></p>
<p id="L149">"There are many excellent craftsmen, but ...... our territory, which does not face the sea, has almost no skills in building military ships. I don't think it would be of any use to lend them out."<br><sup>「確かに優秀な職人は多いが……海に面していない我が領は軍船の造船技術などほぼ皆無だぞ。そんな者たちを貸したところで役には立たないと思うが」</sup><br><sup>"There are certainly many good craftsmen, but... our territory, which does not face the sea, has almost no shipbuilding technology for military ships.I don't think it's useful to lend them."</sup></p>
<p id="L150"><br></p>
<p id="L151">"That's true, but we could use a skilled carpenter to build a stronger ship, and more importantly, our territory is short on hands. Will you do me a favor?"<br><sup>「それはそうだが、腕のいい大工職人を使えばより頑丈な船が作れるし、何より我が領としても手が足りないのだ。何とか頼まれてはくれないか」</sup><br><sup>"That's true, but a good carpenter can make a stronger ship, and above all, our territory is short of hands.Will you do me a favor?"</sup></p>
<p id="L152"><br></p>
<p id="L153">"No, but even so, ...... we have to build houses for the immigrants we are still accepting, and we are also busy with flood control work on the river and rebuilding old buildings.<br><sup>「いや、そうは言ってもだな……今も受け入れ続けている移民に家も作らないとならないし、河川の治水工事やら古い建物の建て直しやらでこちらもいっぱいいっぱいなのだよ」</sup><br><sup>"No, that being said... we have to build houses for immigrants who still accept it, and it's full of river flood control work and old buildings."</sup></p>
<p id="L154"><br></p>
<p id="L155">"Mmm, well at ......, can we at least reduce the amount of free food we give away every year?"<br><sup>「むう、そうか……では、せめて毎年無償支援している食料をもっと減らせないだろうか」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I see... so can't we at least reduce the amount of free food we provide every year?"</sup></p>
<p id="L156"><br></p>
<p id="L157">"I can help you with that. I'll give you an estimate later."<br><sup>「それなら協力できるだろう。後で試算しておくよ」</sup><br><sup>"Then we can cooperate.I'll give you an estimate later."</sup></p>
<p id="L158"><br></p>
<p id="L159">When Narson nodded, there was a knock at the door of the room.<br><sup>ナルソンが頷いた時、部屋の扉がノックされた。</sup><br><sup>When Naruson nodded, the door of the room was knocked.</sup></p>
<p id="L160">The door opened and a nervous-looking maid came in and bowed her head.<br><sup>扉が開き、緊張で強張った顔をした侍女が入ってきてふかぶかと頭を下げる。</sup><br><sup>The door opens, and a maid with a tense face walks in and bows her head softly.</sup></p>
<p id="L161"><br></p>
<p id="L162">"Excuse me. The banquet is ready."<br><sup>「失礼いたします。宴の準備が整いましてございます」</sup><br><sup>"Excuse me.The banquet is ready."</sup></p>
<p id="L163"><br></p>
<p id="L164">"Hmm. We are in the middle of a conversation, but let's go to the venue. We'll continue later.<br><sup>「うむ。皆様、話の途中ですが、会場に参りましょう。続きはまた後ほど」</sup><br><sup>"Well, ladies and gentlemen, let's go to the meeting place.See you later."</sup></p>
<p id="L165"><br></p>
<p id="L166"><br></p>
<p id="L167"><br></p>
<p id="L168">When and who came up with the name "New Year's Eve Party" is an eternal mystery that even the organizers do not know.<br><sup>『年越しの宴』という何とも捻りのない名称をいつ誰が付けたのか、それは主催している本人たちも知らない永遠の謎である。</sup><br><sup>It is an eternal mystery that even the organizers themselves do not know when and who gave the name "New Year's banquet."</sup></p>
<p id="L169">I am not even sure if this has been done since the country was founded, or if it was done when the country was still a collection of small tribes.<br><sup>国が興った時から行われているのか、はたまたこの国がまだ小さな部族の集まりだった頃から行われていたのかも定かではない。</sup><br><sup>It is unclear whether it has been happening since the country was founded or whether it has been happening since the country was still a small tribal gathering.</sup></p>
<p id="L170">Anyway, it is easy to guess that this was the initial purpose of the banquet by looking at the form of the banquet that has been handed down to this day.<br><sup>ともあれ、最初の目的はこうだったであろうことは、今に伝わっている宴の形式を見ればおのずと推測できる。</sup><br><sup>At any rate, it can be inferred from the present form of feast that the original purpose would have been this.</sup></p>
<p id="L171">At any rate, they would gather for whatever reason, drink and frolic, make as many connections as they could, and hopefully meet their future spouse in a fateful encounter.<br><sup>とりあえず理由をつけて集まり、大騒ぎしながら酒を飲み、作れるだけのコネをこしらえて、あわよくば将来の伴侶と運命の出会いを果たすのだ。</sup><br><sup>First of all, they get together for a reason, drink and make a lot of noise, and make enough connections to meet their future partner.</sup></p>
<p id="L172"><br></p>
<p id="L173">"Oh, this is so annoying. Can't I just take a break?"<br><sup>「うう、めんどくさいなあ。休んじゃダメかなあ？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's troublesome.Why don't you rest?"</sup></p>
<p id="L174"><br></p>
<p id="L175">Dressed in a crimson dress, Lise sighed heavily in front of the mirror.<br><sup>真紅のドレスに身を包み、リーゼは鏡の前で大きくため息をついた。</sup><br><sup>Wearing a crimson dress, Liese sighed loudly in front of the mirror.</sup></p>
<p id="L176">From behind her, Eira is doing a final check of her dress.<br><sup>そんな彼女の後ろから、エイラはドレスの最終チェックを行っている。</sup><br><sup>Behind her, Ayla checks her dress for the last time.</sup></p>
<p id="L177"><br></p>
<p id="L178">"If Miss Lise were to be absent, the gentlemen in attendance would start a riot. Please give up and work hard until morning."<br><sup>「リーゼ様が欠席なんてしたら、来場された殿方が暴動を起こします。諦めて朝まで頑張ってきてください」</sup><br><sup>"If Mr. Liese is absent, the lord who came will riot.Please give up and do your best until morning."</sup></p>
<p id="L179"><br></p>
<p id="L180">"I don't know why we're having a party from dinner time until the sun comes up. I don't care how long it is, it's too long.<br><sup>「暴動ってあんたね……ていうか、何で夕食時から朝日が昇るまでずっと宴会なんだろうね。いくらなんでも長すぎる気がするんだけど」</sup><br><sup>"Rioting is you... I mean, why is it all the time from dinner to sunrise?I think everything is too long."</sup></p>
<p id="L181"><br></p>
<p id="L182">"Yes, ...... is my guess, but as the country grew, the size of the banquets grew, and the time required for greetings increased, and as a result, the banquets became longer and longer.<br><sup>「そうですね……これは私の推測ですが、国が大きくなるにつれて宴会の規模が大きくなって、挨拶に要する時間が増えた結果、ずるずると延びていったのではないでしょうか」</sup><br><sup>"Well... this is my guess, as the country grew larger, the size of the banquet grew, and as a result of the increase in the time required for greetings, I think it was delayed."</sup></p>
<p id="L183"><br></p>
<p id="L184">"Wow, something very like that. Also, if it's until morning, it's a good time slot for a man and a woman who got along that night to spend the night together."<br><sup>「うわ、何かすごくそれっぽい。あと、朝までだったらその晩に仲良くなった男女が一夜を共にするのにもちょうどいい時間配分だよね」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, there seems to be something like that.Also, if it's until morning, it's the right time for a man and a woman to spend the night together."</sup></p>
<p id="L185"><br></p>
<p id="L186">"Oh, I guess that's possible, too. It's called "morning chun.<br><sup>「あー、それもありそうですね。朝チュンっていうやつですか」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's probably true.Is it called Chun in the morning?"</sup></p>
<p id="L187"><br></p>
<p id="L188">"Morning chun?　What's that?"<br><sup>「朝チュン？　なにそれ？」</sup><br><sup>"Morning Chun? What's that?"</sup></p>
<p id="L189"><br></p>
<p id="L190">At the unfamiliar word, Lise looks at Eira through the mirror.<br><sup>聞きなれない単語に、リーゼが鏡越しにエイラを見る。</sup><br><sup>Liese looks at Ayla through the mirror at a word she is not familiar with.</sup></p>
<p id="L191"><br></p>
<p id="L192">"Kazura-sama said that after a man and a woman spend the night together, they wake up in the morning to the sound of birds singing.<br><sup>「男女が一晩を伴にした後、朝に鳥のさえずりを聞きながら目覚めることってカズラ様がおっしゃっていました」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Kazura said that men and women wake up listening to birds chirping in the morning after spending the night together."</sup></p>
<p id="L193"><br></p>
<p id="L194">"......, what do you guys usually talk about? I mean, when did you guys become such good friends?"<br><sup>「……あんたち、普段どんな話してるのよ。ていうか、いつの間にそんな話ができる仲になってたわけ？」</sup><br><sup>"...what do you usually talk about?I mean, before you knew it, you could talk about it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L195"><br></p>
<p id="L196">"No, no, we just happened to be talking about it when we were standing there.<br><sup>「い、いえ、たまたま立ち話した時にそんな話になっただけですよ」</sup><br><sup>"No, no, that's just what happened when we happened to stand up and talk."</sup></p>
<p id="L197"><br></p>
<p id="L198">"I'm sure it's not a downer, just an accidental stand-off."<br><sup>「たまたまの立ち話で下ネタにはならないでしょうが」</sup><br><sup>"I don't think it's going to be a dirty joke because it happens to be a standing story."</sup></p>
<p id="L199"><br></p>
<p id="L200">"Yeah, uh, ......."<br><sup>「え、ええと……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, let's see..."</sup></p>
<p id="L201"><br></p>
<p id="L202">As Eira was at a loss for an answer, there was a knock at the door of the room.<br><sup>エイラが答えに窮していると、部屋の扉がノックされた。</sup><br><sup>When Ayla was at a loss for an answer, the door of the room was knocked.</sup></p>
<p id="L203">The door opened, and the maid of honor peeked out and said impatiently, "I want you to hurry because the opening remarks are about to begin.<br><sup>扉が開き、そろそろ開宴の挨拶が始まってしまうので急いで欲しい、と顔を覗かせた侍女が焦り顔で言う。</sup><br><sup>The door opens and the opening greeting begins soon, so the maid peeping into her face says with a impatient look of impatience, "I want you to hurry."</sup></p>

<p id="L207">Eira pushed Lise back in a panic and hurried her to the door.<br><sup>エイラは慌てた様子でリーゼの背中を押し、扉へと急がせる。</sup><br><sup>Ayla pushes Liese on the back in a hurry and hastens her to the door.</sup></p>
<p id="L208"><br></p>
<p id="L209">"Well, it's kind of indigestible. ...... Oh, is Kazura asking what we're doing tonight?"<br><sup>「えー、何か消化不良だなあ……あ、カズラは今夜どうするか聞いてる？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, you have some indigestion... Oh, are you asking what Kazura is going to do tonight?"</sup></p>
