<p id="L1">The morning after two weeks.<br><sup>２週間後の朝。</sup><br><sup>Two weeks later, in the morning.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">On the rooftop of Narson's mansion, Kazuyoshi and Lise were crouched in front of a few flowerpots.<br><sup>ナルソン邸の屋上で、一良とリーゼは数個の植木鉢の前にしゃがみ込んでいた。</sup><br><sup>On the roof of Narson's house, Ichira and Liese squatted in front of several flower pots.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">The medicinal plants in the pots have all grown to nearly double their original size.<br><sup>鉢の中の薬草は、そのどれもが元の倍近くの大きさにまで成長している。</sup><br><sup>All the herbs in the pot have grown to nearly double their original size.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">New shoots are peeking out from the base of the plant, and I think I can divide the plant at this rate.<br><sup>根元からは新たな芽が顔を覗かせていて、このぶんなら株分けもできそうだ。</sup><br><sup>There are new buds at the roots, and I think I can divide the plants.</sup></p>
<p id="L5"><br></p>
<p id="L6">"Fertilizer is amazing. If it grows so fast, we can make all the medicines we want.<br><sup>「やっぱり肥料ってすごいね。これだけ一気に大きくなるなら、薬も作り放題だよ」</sup><br><sup>"Fertilizer is great, after all.If it grows so big all at once, you can make as many medicine as you want."</sup></p>
<p id="L7"><br></p>
<p id="L8">While Liese was happy, Kazura was staring at the herbs and thinking about them.<br><sup>嬉しそうにしているリーゼをよそに、一良は薬草を見つめて考え込んでいた。</sup><br><sup>Despite Liese's happy appearance, Ichira looked at the herbs and thought deeply.</sup></p>
<p id="L9">The medicinal herbs are growing rapidly due to the effect of the fertilizer, but not as explosively as the vegetables in the Gricean village.<br><sup>薬草は肥料の効果で急成長をしてはいるのだが、グリセア村の野菜のような爆発的な成長はしていない。</sup><br><sup>Medicinal plants are growing rapidly due to fertilizer effects, but they are not as explosive as the vegetables in Glyceria.</sup></p>
<p id="L10">From what I can tell, the herbs themselves have less vitality than other plants.<br><sup>これから考えるに、薬草自体の生命力はその他の植物よりも弱いということなのだろう。</sup><br><sup>From now on, the vitality of herbs themselves is weaker than that of other plants.</sup></p>
<p id="L11">The fact that they are often found on cliffs and rock faces at high altitudes may be the result of their survival zone being driven out by other plants.<br><sup>高地の崖や岩肌に生息していることが多いというのも、他の植物に生存圏を追いやられた結果なのかもしれない。</sup><br><sup>Most of them live on high-altitude cliffs and rocky surfaces, perhaps because other plants have forced them to survive.</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">"What's wrong?"<br><sup>「どうしたの？」</sup><br><sup>"What's the matter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L14"><br></p>
<p id="L15">"No, it's nothing. It seems to have worked for now, so let's divide the plants."<br><sup>「いや、なんでもない。とりあえず上手くいったみたいだし、株分けするか」</sup><br><sup>"Nothing.Anyway, it seems to have worked out well, so let's split the shares."</sup></p>
<p id="L16"><br></p>
<p id="L17">"Yeah."<br><sup>「うん」</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L18"><br></p>
<p id="L19">Next to the pots with medicinal herbs growing in them were empty flowerpots, cloth bags filled with soil, and fertilizer brought by Kazuyoshi.<br><sup>薬草の生えている鉢の横には、空の植木鉢と土の入った布袋、そして一良の持ち込んだ肥料が置かれていた。</sup><br><sup>Next to the pot where the herbs grew was an empty flowerpot, a cloth bag containing soil, and fertilizer brought in by Ichira.</sup></p>
<p id="L20">The bowl was made of earthenware and was simple, with no particular pattern.<br><sup>鉢は土器製で、特に柄もなくシンプルなものである。</sup><br><sup>The pots are made of earthenware and are simple without any particular handle.</sup></p>
<p id="L21"><br></p>
<p id="L22">"I mean, why didn't you tell the servants to keep the soil in?"<br><sup>「ていうか、何で使用人に土を入れておくように言っておかなかったんだ？」</sup><br><sup>"I mean, why didn't you tell your servant to keep the soil?"</sup></p>
<p id="L23"><br></p>
<p id="L24">Kazuyoshi said as he lifted the cloth bag and transferred the soil to the pot.<br><sup>布袋を持ち上げて鉢に土を移しながら、一良が言う。</sup><br><sup>Kazura says, lifting the cloth bag and transferring the soil to the bowl.</sup></p>
<p id="L25">Liese helps her with this, holding the mouth of the bag so that the soil doesn't spill out of the pot.<br><sup>リーゼはそれを手伝って、鉢の外に土がこぼれないように袋の口を押さえている。</sup><br><sup>Liese helped him hold the mouth of the bag so that the soil wouldn't spill out of the pot.</sup></p>
<p id="L26">It was Lise who instructed the servants to prepare the flowerpots and soil.<br><sup>使用人に植木鉢や土を用意するように指示を出したのはリーゼだ。</sup><br><sup>It was Liese who instructed her servants to prepare flower pots and soil.</sup></p>
<p id="L27"><br></p>
<p id="L28">"I wanted to work with Kazura."<br><sup>「カズラと一緒にやりたいなと思って」</sup><br><sup>"I wanted to do it with Kazura."</sup></p>
<p id="L29"><br></p>
<p id="L30">When Kazuyoshi looked at Lise with a bit of dismay at her words, Lise turned her gaze to Kazuyoshi with a grin.<br><sup>その言葉に一良が少しどきりとしてリーゼを見ると、リーゼはにやりとした視線を一良に向けた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira looked at Liese with a little excitement at her words, Liese looked at her with a smile.</sup></p>
<p id="L31"><br></p>
<p id="L32">"Are you thrilled?　Didn't I scare you?"<br><sup>「どきっとした？　どきっとしたよね？」</sup><br><sup>"Are you surprised? You were shocked, weren't you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L33"><br></p>
<p id="L34">"Yeah, I don't do that.<br><sup>「ええい、するかそんなもん」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I'll do that,"</sup></p>
<p id="L35"><br></p>
<p id="L36">"Lying is not good. You're not sincere enough."<br><sup>「嘘はよくないなー。誠実さが足りないなー」</sup><br><sup>"It's not good to lie.You don't have enough sincerity."</sup></p>
<p id="L37"><br></p>
<p id="L38">As I was filling the pot with soil, talking lightly as usual, a strong wind blew across the rooftop.<br><sup>いつものように軽口を叩きながら鉢に土を入れていると、屋上に強い風が吹いた。</sup><br><sup>As usual, I was pouring soil into the bowl and blowing a strong wind on the roof.</sup></p>
<p id="L39">The wind was cold and they shrank back involuntarily.<br><sup>風は冷たく、思わず２人は身を縮める。</sup><br><sup>The wind was cold, and they shrank involuntarily.</sup></p>
<p id="L40"><br></p>
<p id="L41">"...... I don't know, the temperature has dropped dramatically in the past few days. It's like we've barely had an autumn period at all."<br><sup>「……なんだか、ここ数日で一気に気温が下がったな。秋の期間がほとんどなかったような気がする」</sup><br><sup>"...the temperature has dropped all at once in the last few days.I don't think there was much autumn."</sup></p>
<p id="L42"><br></p>
<p id="L43">"Just when I thought it was finally getting cooler around the end of September, it's already blowing like winter.<br><sup>「ほんとそうだよね。９月の終わりぐらいからようやく涼しくなってきたと思ったら、もう冬みたいな風が吹いてるし」</sup><br><sup>"That's true, isn't it?I thought it was finally getting cooler around the end of September, but there was already a winter wind."</sup></p>
<p id="L44"><br></p>
<p id="L45">It was now late October, and the temperature had dropped dramatically over the past two weeks.<br><sup>今は10月下旬であり、ここ２週間の間に一気に気温が下がってきていた。</sup><br><sup>It's late October and the temperature has dropped all at once over the past two weeks.</sup></p>
<p id="L46">In the breadbasket, the harvest of potatoes is over and the seeds of wheat and beans have just been sown.<br><sup>穀倉地帯では芋類の収穫が終わり、つい先日麦や豆の種蒔きを行ったところだ。</sup><br><sup>Potatoes have been harvested in the granary area and have just sown wheat and beans.</sup></p>
<p id="L47">We've had a few rains to go along with the drop in temperature, so the winter crops will grow without any problems.<br><sup>気温の低下に合わせて雨も何度か降ったので、冬に収穫する作物は問題なく育つだろう。</sup><br><sup>As the temperature drops, it rains several degrees, so the crops harvested in winter will grow well.</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">"Oh, by the way, when are you going to teach Freisland how to make salt?　Now that summer is over, maybe next year?"<br><sup>「そういえば、フライス領に製塩手法を教えるのはいつにするの？　夏も終わっちゃったし、また来年かな？」</sup><br><sup>"Come to think of it, when are you going to teach the milling industry how to make salt?Summer is over, and maybe next year?"</sup></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51">"No, when we're finished here, I'm going to send some craftsmen over there to propose a new method of salt production when the time is right. It's quite efficient and can be done in winter.<br><sup>「いや、こっちの工事が一段落したら、向こうに職人を何人か送って、頃合を見計らって新しい製塩手法を提案させようと思うんだ。かなり効率のいい方法で、冬でもできるんだよ」</sup><br><sup>"No, when the construction is over here, I'm going to send some craftsmen over there to suggest a new salt making method at the right time.It's a pretty efficient way to do it even in winter."</sup></p>
<p id="L52"><br></p>
<p id="L53">"Oh, you can make salt in the winter?"<br><sup>「え、冬でも製塩できるの？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, can you make salt even in winter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L54"><br></p>
<p id="L55">"I can do it. We'll use a tool called a branch and branch rack, but I think it's more efficient in the winter when it's windy and dry.<br><sup>「できるできる。<ruby><rb>枝条架</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>しじょうか</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>っていう道具を使うんだけど、それだとむしろ風が強くて乾燥してる冬のほうが効率いいんじゃないかな」</sup><br><sup>"I can do it.I use a tool called a branch rack, but I think it would be more efficient in the windy and dry winter."</sup></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">When Kazuyoshi explained the structure of the tool, Lise nodded in admiration, "I see.<br><sup>一良が道具の構造を説明すると、リーゼは「なるほど」と感心した様子で頷いた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira explained the structure of the tool, Liese nodded admiringly, "I see."</sup></p>
<p id="L58">A branch-and-strip rack is a device in which bundles of bamboo twigs are tied to a pillar and seawater is poured through it, evaporating the water with the wind and concentrating the salt.<br><sup>枝条架とは、柱に竹の小枝を束にしたものを結びつけ、そこに海水を流して風で水分を蒸発させ、塩分を濃縮させる装置だ。</sup><br><sup>A branch rack is a device that binds bamboo twigs together to a pillar and flows seawater to it to evaporate water and concentrate salt.</sup></p>
<p id="L59">If it is midsummer, seawater can be poured over the paved gravel to evaporate some of the water, and then applied to the branch-and-row racks to improve efficiency.<br><sup>真夏であれば、敷き詰めた砂利の上に海水を流し、ある程度水分を蒸発させたものを枝条架にかけることで効率化を図ることもできる。</sup><br><sup>In the middle of summer, seawater can be poured onto gravel and water evaporated to a certain extent on a branch rack to improve efficiency.</sup></p>
<p id="L60">The collected seawater is then boiled down in a large pot to produce salt.<br><sup>そうして集めた海水を大鍋で煮詰めれば、塩が出来上がるというわけだ。</sup><br><sup>In other words, salt can be made by boiling the collected seawater in a large pot.</sup></p>
<p id="L61"><br></p>
<p id="L62">"Bamboo would be easier to make, but do we have bamboo in this world?　It's a wood with a cylindrical shape and a shiny surface.<br><sup>「竹があれば作りやすいんだけど、こっちの世界に竹ってあるかな？　筒状で表面がつやつやしてる木なんだけど」</sup><br><sup>"It would be easy to make with bamboo, but is there bamboo in this world?It's a cylindrical tree with a glossy surface."</sup></p>
<p id="L63"><br></p>
<p id="L64">"I've never heard of it, but ...... there's a lot of stuff coming in from southern island countries, so maybe they're imported into the Freis territory.<br><sup>「私は聞いたことないけど……南の島国からは色んなものが入ってくるから、もしかしたらフライス領になら輸入されてるかもしれないよ」</sup><br><sup>"I've never heard of it, but... there's a lot of stuff coming in from the southern island country, so maybe it's imported into Milling territory."</sup></p>
<p id="L65"><br></p>
<p id="L66">"I'll have to look into it later. Well, if you don't have it, I can get it for you, or we can find something to replace it, and we'll figure it out."<br><sup>「そっか、じゃあ後で調べておかないとな。まあ、なくても俺が持ってくればいいし、代わりのものを何か探してもいいし、なんとかなるだろ」</sup><br><sup>"Well, then I'll have to look into it later.Well, if you don't have it, I can bring it, or you can find something to replace it, and you can manage it."</sup></p>
<p id="L67"><br></p>
<p id="L68">Bamboo only lives in warm and humid climates, so it doesn't seem to grow in this area.<br><sup>竹は温暖で湿潤な気候の土地にしか生息しないため、この辺りでは生えていないようだ。</sup><br><sup>Bamboo doesn't seem to grow around here because it only lives in warm and wet climates.</sup></p>
<p id="L69">If bamboo is available in our world, that's great, but if not, we can substitute it with wood or bring bamboo from Japan.<br><sup>もしこちらの世界でも竹が手に入ればそれに越したことはないが、なければないで木材などで代用するか、日本から竹を持ってきてしまえばいい。</sup><br><sup>If you can get bamboo in this world, it's better, but if you don't, you can replace it with wood or bring bamboo from Japan.</sup></p>
<p id="L70">The back of the Japanese mansion is a deep bamboo forest, so we could probably procure it by cutting it out from there.<br><sup>日本の屋敷の裏は深い竹林になっているので、そこから切り出せば調達できるだろう。</sup><br><sup>The back of a Japanese house is a deep bamboo forest, so if you cut it out of it, you will be able to procure it.</sup></p>
<p id="L71"><br></p>
<p id="L72">"Fry's territory. ...... I hope you're doing well, Lady Hayshel.<br><sup>「フライス領かあ……ヘイシェル様、元気にしてるかな」</sup><br><sup>"Is it milling territory?"How are you, Mr. Hachel?"</sup></p>
<p id="L73"><br></p>
<p id="L74">Liese said, and narrowed her eyes nostalgically.<br><sup>リーゼはそう言うと、懐かしそうに目を細めた。</sup><br><sup>Liese squinted fondly as she said so.</sup></p>
<p id="L75"><br></p>
<p id="L76">"Hmm, are you acquainted with the lords of Millington?"<br><sup>「ん、フライス領の領主と顔見知りなのか？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, are you acquainted with the lord of the Mills?"</sup></p>
<p id="L77"><br></p>
<p id="L78">"Yes, your father has taken me there a few times, and we've talked about it. At the end of the year, some territory hosts a banquet, and we'll meet there too."<br><sup>「うん、何度かお父様に連れて行ってもらったことがあって、その時に話したことがあるの。年末になるとどこかの領地が主催して宴を開くんだけど、そこでも会うね」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, my father took me there a few times, and I told him about it then.At the end of the year, a banquet is held hosted by some territory, and we meet there."</sup></p>
<p id="L79"><br></p>
<p id="L80">"Is some territory different every year?"<br><sup>「どこかの領地って、毎年違うのか？」</sup><br><sup>"Is any territory different from year to year?"</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">"Yes. It's not a specific event, but it's hosted by the royal capital and each territory in turn. It's not that formal, it's more like a New Year's Eve party where we eat and drink until morning. All the important people in the country gather there, so the night always ends before I can get around to greet them.<br><sup>「うん。特に決まってはいないんだけど、王都と各領地が順番に主催してるね。そんなに形式ばったものじゃなくて、年越しに合わせて朝まで飲み食いするって感じ。国中の有力者が集まるから、挨拶して回ってるうちにいつも夜が明けちゃうんだけどね」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I haven't decided anything in particular, but the royal capital and the territories are hosting it in turn.It's not that formal, it's like eating and drinking until morning according to the New Year's holiday.It's always dawn while I'm greeting and going around because influential people from all over the country gather."</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">In short, it's probably a combination of a year-end party and a New Year's party.<br><sup>要は、忘年会と新年会が合わさったような行事なのだろう。</sup><br><sup>The point is, it's like a year-end party and a New Year's party.</sup></p>
<p id="L85">There must be a lot of noblemen who only see each other on such occasions, so it's no wonder that it becomes a battle of greetings.<br><sup>そういった場でしか顔を合わせないような貴族も大勢いるはずなので、挨拶合戦になるというのにも頷ける。</sup><br><sup>There must be a lot of aristocrats who only meet in such situations, so I can nod that it will be a greeting battle.</sup></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">We used to go back and forth a lot," he said. Lately, we don't have that kind of time anymore because of the difficulties in our territory.<br><sup>「ヘイシェル様とお父様は特に仲がよくて、前はよく行き来してたんだよね。最近はこっちの領内が大変だから、そんな余裕なくなっちゃったけど」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Herschel and your father were especially close, and used to go back and forth a lot.These days, it's hard in my territory, so I can't afford it anymore."</sup></p>
<p id="L88"><br></p>
<p id="L89">"Well, looking at you now, Mr. Narson, it doesn't look like you can afford to go out. ......<br><sup>「まあ、今のナルソンさん見てると出かけてる余裕なんてなさそうだもんな……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I don't think I can afford to go out now..."</sup></p>
<p id="L90"><br></p>
<p id="L91">With the territory in a critical situation due to famine and financial difficulties, Narson would not have been able to leave the territory.<br><sup>飢饉と財政難で領内が危機的状況にあっては、ナルソンも領地を離れることはできなかったのだろう。</sup><br><sup>If the territory was in crisis due to famine and financial difficulties, Naruseong would not have been able to leave the territory.</sup></p>
<p id="L92">There seems to be no mention of Heyshel visiting Istair territory during that time, so he may have been careful and refrained from doing so.<br><sup>その間にヘイシェルがイステール領を訪れたという話はないようなので、気を使って自粛していたのかもしれない。</sup><br><sup>There seems to have been no mention of Herschel's visit to Istair during that time, so he may have refrained from doing so with care.</sup></p>
<p id="L93">The situation in the territory has calmed down somewhat lately, so Narson will be able to join the party at the end of the year.<br><sup>最近は領内の状況もやや落ち着いてきているので、年末の宴にはナルソンも参加できるだろう。</sup><br><sup>Recently, the situation in the territory has calmed down a little, and Naruseong will be able to attend the year-end party.</sup></p>
<p id="L94">The next time he will return to Japan will be around the end of the year.<br><sup>ちなみに、次に一良が日本に戻るのはちょうど年末ごろになる予定だ。</sup><br><sup>Incidentally, the next time Ichira returns to Japan will be around the end of the year.</sup></p>
<p id="L95">The mission was to replenish supplies and check the progress of the river construction drawings.<br><sup>用件は物資の補給と河川工事図面の進捗確認である。</sup><br><sup>The main task is to supply supplies and confirm the progress of river engineering drawings.</sup></p>
<p id="L96"><br></p>
<p id="L97">"It's reassuring to know that you're on good terms with the local lords who are supporting you.<br><sup>「それにしても、支援してくれてる地域の領主と仲良しっていうのは心強いな」</sup><br><sup>"Even so, it's reassuring to be close to the lord of the area who supports me."</sup></p>
<p id="L98"><br></p>
<p id="L99">"Yes. They're still doing their best to support us, and they're really helping us. It seems that during the last war, they were forcing themselves to continue to provide food aid, and if it weren't for the Freis territory, this country would have been destroyed long ago.<br><sup>「うん。今も一生懸命支援してくれてるし、本当に助かってるよ。この間の戦争の時もかなり無理して食糧支援を続けてくれてたみたいだし、フライス領がなかったらこの国はとっくに滅んでたんじゃないかな」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, you're still working hard to support me, and I'm really saved.During the last war, they seemed to have forced themselves to continue providing food aid, and I think this country would have long been destroyed without the Milling Territory."</sup></p>
<p id="L100"><br></p>
<p id="L101">Apparently, the Freis territory has a rather important position in Arcadia.<br><sup>どうやら、アルカディアにおいてフライス領はかなり重要な立ち位置にあるようだ。</sup><br><sup>Apparently, the Milling Territory is in a very important position in Arcadia.</sup></p>
<p id="L102">The Isthmus of Isthmus is standing in the face of the enemy, and they are supporting us in the form of logistical support.<br><sup>敵国の矢面に立っているイステール領の足元を、後方支援というかたちでしっかりと支えてくれているのだろう。</sup><br><sup>It must be firmly supporting the feet of Istair, who is facing the brunt of the enemy country, in the form of logistic support.</sup></p>
<p id="L103">They may have been providing similar support to Gregorian territory and the royal capital.<br><sup>グレゴルン領や王都に対しても、似たような支援を行っていたのかもしれない。</sup><br><sup>Similar support may have been provided to Gregorne's territory and the royal capital.</sup></p>
<p id="L104"><br></p>
<p id="L105">"Unlike Istehr, the land in Freis is fertile and the food is very good. The markets in the city are always bustling, and the citizens are very lively, so it's a very nice place.<br><sup>「フライス領はイステール領と違って土地が肥沃で食べ物はすごく美味しいし、南側は海だから海産物とか交易品も入ってきて裕福なんだよね。街の市場はいつもにぎやかだし、市民に活気があってすごくいいところだよ」</sup><br><sup>"Unlike the Istair Territory, the land is fertile and the food is very delicious, and the sea is in the south, so seafood and trade goods come in and they are rich.The markets in the city are always lively and the citizens are lively and it'</sup></p>
<p id="L106"><br></p>
<p id="L107">"That's a great place. ...... Speaking of which, even though there's a famine over here due to sunshine, the amount of food aid from Millington is increasing.<br><sup>「そりゃすごいところだな……そういえば、こっちは日照りで飢饉になってるっていうのに、フライス領からの食糧支援量は増えてるんだっけ」</sup><br><sup>"That's a great place... Come to think of it, the amount of food aid from the Milling Territory is increasing even though there is a famine here due to the drought."</sup></p>
<p id="L108"><br></p>
<p id="L109">When I had heard about the territory from Narson before, he had explained to me that the amount of food aid from Gregorian territory to the west was decreasing rapidly, while that from Freis territory to the south was increasing.<br><sup>以前ナルソンから領内の話を聞いた際、西のグレゴルン領からの食糧支援量は急激に減っているが、南のフライス領からのものは増えていると説明を受けたことがあった。</sup><br><sup>When I heard from Naruson about the territory, he explained that the amount of food aid from the western Gregorne territory was decreasing sharply, but the amount from the southern territory of Milling was increasing.</sup></p>
<p id="L110">The fact that food production has been increasing despite this sunshine must mean that there are plenty of water sources in the territory.<br><sup>この日照りにも負けずに食糧生産量が増えているということは、領内には水源が豊富にあるのだろう。</sup><br><sup>The fact that food production is increasing despite this drought means that there are abundant water sources in the territory.</sup></p>
<p id="L111">This is in stark contrast to the Isthmus, where water shortages were causing havoc.<br><sup>水不足で大変なことになっていたイステール領とは対照的だ。</sup><br><sup>This is in contrast to the Istair region, which was in serious trouble due to lack of water.</sup></p>
<p id="L112"><br></p>
<p id="L113">"The Millington territory has never known famine. On the contrary, we've been able to take advantage of the sunshine to increase our salt production a little, and we're the most blessed of all the countries.<br><sup>「フライス領は飢饉知らずだからね。逆に日照りを利用して塩の生産が少し増えて儲かってるくらいだし、国の中じゃ一番恵まれてるんじゃないかな」</sup><br><sup>"for the Milling Territory knows no famine."On the other hand, salt production has increased a little by taking advantage of the drought, and I think it's the most fortunate of all."</sup></p>
<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115">"But how can you be so economically strong and still follow the instructions of the capital to pay taxes and provide food aid to other territories? It seems to me that you might rebel a little."<br><sup>「でも、そんなに経済的に強いのに、よく王都の指示に従って税金納めたり他領に食料支援を頑張ったりしてるな。少しは反発しそうに思えるけど」</sup><br><sup>"But even though he is so financially strong, he often pays taxes and helps other territories with food.I think I'm going to protest a little bit."</sup></p>

<p id="L117">"There are no mineral resources in Millington, and the land is mostly flat, so there are no strategic points for defense.

<p id="L121">"But that's why the agriculture and the cities are growing so fast.
