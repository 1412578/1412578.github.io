<p id="L1">In the sunset-colored forest, Colts wriggled his feet as he faced the scarecrow standing in front of him.<br><sup>夕焼け色に染まる森の中、コルツは目の前に立てられたカカシと向き合いながら、もぞもぞと足を動かしていた。</sup><br><sup>In the woods tinged with sunset, Colts shuffled his feet, facing the mustard standing in front of him.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">A wooden stick is held in his hand, and the part he is holding is slightly rubbed and becoming darker.<br><sup>手には木の棒が握られており、握っている部分は若干擦れて黒くなってきている。</sup><br><sup>He had a wooden stick in his hand, and his grip was getting a little blackened.</sup></p>
<p id="L3"><br></p>
<p id="L4">"Hmmm ......, something's not right. I've been watching my sister Baretta do it for a while now. ......"<br><sup>「うーん……何か違うんだよな。バレッタ姉ちゃんがやってるの、ちゃんと見てたんだけどなあ……」</sup><br><sup>"Well... there's something wrong.I was watching Valletta do it properly..."</sup></p>
<p id="L5"><br></p>
<p id="L6">I held up the stick, remembering the way I had seen Baretta train before.<br><sup>以前見たバレッタの訓練姿を思い出しながら、棒を構える。</sup><br><sup>He holds up a stick while remembering the training of Valletta he saw before.</sup></p>
<p id="L7">He moved his right half of his body forward and grasped the stick at his waist.<br><sup>右半身を前に出すようにし、棒を腰の位置で握った。</sup><br><sup>Put your right half forward and hold the stick in your waist position.</sup></p>
<p id="L8">I tried to position myself as she had done, but it just didn't feel right.<br><sup>彼女がやっていたように構えてみるが、どうにもしっくりこない。</sup><br><sup>I try to look like she was doing, but it just doesn't fit.</sup></p>
<p id="L9"><br></p>
<p id="L10">"Your legs are too closed. Let's widen them by one more foot."<br><sup>「足が閉じすぎています。あと足１つ分広げましょう」</sup><br><sup>"My feet are too closed.Let's spread one more leg."</sup></p>
<p id="L11"><br></p>
<p id="L12">"Oh my God!"<br><sup>「うわあっ！？」</sup><br><sup>"What!"</sup></p>
<p id="L13"><br></p>
<p id="L14">Suddenly, someone called out to him from behind, and his heart leapt out of his mouth in surprise.<br><sup>不意に背後から声をかけられ、コルツは口から心臓が飛び出さんばかりに驚いた。</sup><br><sup>Suddenly, Colts was called out from behind, and his heart almost popped out of his mouth.</sup></p>
<p id="L15">I turned around and saw a young woman with long black hair standing there.<br><sup>振り向くと、そこには長い黒髪の若い女が立っていた。</sup><br><sup>When I turned around, I saw a young woman with long black hair standing there.</sup></p>
<p id="L16">He wears a cloak over his long-sleeved traveling clothes and a long sword at his waist.<br><sup>長袖の旅服の上に外套をまとい、腰には長剣を挿している。</sup><br><sup>He wore an overcoat over his long-sleeved traveling suit and a long sword around his waist.</sup></p>
<p id="L17">In his hand he was holding a woven wooden basket with many ripe nuts and mushrooms in it.<br><sup>手には木編みのカゴを下げており、中には熟した木の実やキノコがたくさん入っていた。</sup><br><sup>He had a wooden basket in his hand, and there were many ripe nuts and mushrooms in it.</sup></p>
<p id="L18">He was dressed like a servant of the troops stationed at the entrance of the village, except that he carried a sword.<br><sup>剣を携えている以外は、村の入り口に駐屯している部隊の使用人と同じ格好だ。</sup><br><sup>Except for his sword, he was dressed like a servant of a unit stationed at the entrance of the village.</sup></p>
<p id="L19"><br></p>
<p id="L20">"Do you practice alone?"<br><sup>「１人で練習をしているのですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Are you practicing alone?"</sup></p>
<p id="L21"><br></p>
<p id="L22">"I'm sorry, ......."<br><sup>「……ごめんなさい」</sup><br><sup>"...I'm sorry,"</sup></p>
<p id="L23"><br></p>
<p id="L24">When Colts apologized, she gave him a puzzled look.<br><sup>コルツが謝ると、彼女はきょとんとした顔をした。</sup><br><sup>When Colts apologized, she looked blank.</sup></p>
<p id="L25"><br></p>
<p id="L26">"Why are you apologizing?"<br><sup>「どうして謝るのですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Why are you apologizing?"</sup></p>
<p id="L27"><br></p>
<p id="L28">"Why? ...... She's mad at me because I was hiding and watching her sisters practice, right?"<br><sup>「どうしてって……シア姉ちゃんたちが練習してるのを俺が隠れて見てたから、怒ってるんでしょ？」</sup><br><sup>"Why... you're angry because I was hiding and watching Sia practice, aren't you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L29"><br></p>
<p id="L30">After Colts happened to learn that Baretta and Silvestria were training in martial arts in the forest on the outskirts of the village, he secretly observed them every day.<br><sup>コルツは村はずれの森でバレッタとシルベストリアが武術の訓練をしていることを偶然知ってから、こっそり隠れて毎日見学していた。</sup><br><sup>Colts sneaked around every day after learning by chance that Valletta and Silvestria were training in martial arts in the woods on the outskirts of the village</sup></p>
<p id="L31">He thought that they heard him talking to himself earlier and found out about it, and he was scared that they would be angry with him.<br><sup>さっきの独り言を聞かれてそれがバレたのだと思い、怒られてしまうと怯えているのだ。</sup><br><sup>I think I was caught talking to myself earlier, and I'm afraid I'll get in trouble.</sup></p>
<p id="L32">Incidentally, "Sister Shea" is Silvestria's nickname, as the children call her.<br><sup>ちなみに、シア姉ちゃんとは子供たちが呼んでいるシルベストリアの愛称である。</sup><br><sup>By the way, sister Sia is the nickname Silvestria that children call her.</sup></p>
<p id="L33"><br></p>
<p id="L34">"I'm not mad at you."<br><sup>「別に怒ったりはしませんよ」</sup><br><sup>"I don't get angry at all,"</sup></p>
<p id="L35"><br></p>
<p id="L36">She giggled in annoyance at the jittery Colts.<br><sup>ビクビクしているコルツに、彼女は困ったように苦笑した。</sup><br><sup>She smiled bitterly at the frightened Colts.</sup></p>
<p id="L37"><br></p>
<p id="L38">"But you're going to tell your sister, aren't you?<br><sup>「でも、シア姉ちゃんには言うんでしょ？」</sup><br><sup>"But you're going to tell Sia, aren't you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">"Should I tell him?"<br><sup>「言ったほうがいいですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Should I tell you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42">"No, don't do that!　You're so scary when you're angry!"<br><sup>「や、やめてよ！　シア姉ちゃん、怒るとめちゃくちゃ怖いんだよ！」</sup><br><sup>"Don't do that!"Sister Sia, I'm really scared when I get angry!"</sup></p>
<p id="L43"><br></p>
<p id="L44">Silvestria is usually friendly and very kind, but when she gets really angry, she's not half as powerful.<br><sup>シルベストリアは普段はきさくでとても優しいが、本気で怒った時の迫力は半端ではない。</sup><br><sup>Silvestria is usually open-minded and very kind, but when she really gets angry, she's very powerful.</sup></p>
<p id="L45">A few days ago, while she was playing in the river with her children, one mischievous boy had invaded her tent under the guise of 'exploring'.<br><sup>数日前、彼女が子どもたちと川に遊びに行っている隙に、いたずら好きな１人の男の子が彼女の天幕に『探検』と称して侵入したことがあった。</sup><br><sup>A few days ago, while she was out in the river with her children, a mischievous boy broke into her tent under the name of Exploration.</sup></p>
<p id="L46">When he found the long sword propped up on the bed, he pulled it out of its sheath and started playing with it in the tent.<br><sup>彼はベッドに立てかけてあった長剣を見つけると、こともあろうに鞘から抜いて天幕内で遊びだしてしまったのだ。</sup><br><sup>He found a long sword leaning against the bed, and, no doubt, pulled it out of its sheath and began to play in the tent.</sup></p>
<p id="L47">Then, to make matters worse, Silvestria realized that she had forgotten her fishing rod and came back to the tent.<br><sup>そして間の悪いことに、シルベストリアが釣竿を忘れたことに気づいて天幕に戻ってきてしまった。</sup><br><sup>and, unfortunately, Silvestria found out that she had forgotten her fishing rod and returned to the tent.</sup></p>
<p id="L48">A sword wielded by a boy grazed Silvestria's nose as she entered the tent, unaware of what was happening, and the rest was a hellish scene.<br><sup>何も知らずに天幕に入ったシルベストリアの鼻先ギリギリのところを男の子が振るった剣がかすめ、その後はもう地獄絵図である。</sup><br><sup>Silvestria, who entered the tent without knowing anything, was swept away by a sword wielded by a boy, and after that, it was a picture of hell.</sup></p>
<p id="L49">Shouts of rage that echoed throughout the garrison emanated from her tent, and half an hour later, a boy with tears and snot smeared on his face, shaking and incontinent, was sent home by the soldiers.<br><sup>駐屯地中に響き渡るほどの怒声が彼女の天幕から発され、30分後には涙と鼻水で顔をぐしょぐしょにした男の子がガクガク震えながら失禁した状態で、兵士に家まで送り届けられた。</sup><br><sup>An angry voice echoed through her tent, and half an hour later, a boy whose face was bathed in tears and runny nose was sent home to a soldier, trembling and incontinent.</sup></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51">It was an incident that made the children realize that if they angered Sia-chan, something terrible would happen.<br><sup>シア姉ちゃんを怒らせるととんでもないことになる、という認識が子供たちの間で共有された事件だった。</sup><br><sup>It was an incident in which children shared the idea that it would be ridiculous to make Sia angry.</sup></p>
<p id="L52"><br></p>
<p id="L53">"I understand. I won't say anything, so please don't worry."<br><sup>「分かりました。言いませんから、安心してください」</sup><br><sup>"All right.Don't worry, I won't tell you."</sup></p>
<p id="L54"><br></p>
<p id="L55">"...... Really?"<br><sup>「……本当？」</sup><br><sup>"...Really?"</sup></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">"Yes, it's true.<br><sup>「ええ、本当です」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, it is,"</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">"Don't you ever tell me, okay?　Promise?"<br><sup>「絶対に言わないでよ？　約束だよ？」</sup><br><sup>"Don't ever tell me.It's a promise."</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">"Yes. I promise."<br><sup>「はい。約束です」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I promise."</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63">She smiled gently at Kolz and turned her attention to the stick he was holding.<br><sup>彼女はコルツに優しく微笑むと、彼の持っている棒に目を向けた。</sup><br><sup>She smiled gently at Colts and looked at his stick.</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">"I can teach you the art of swordsmanship, if you like."<br><sup>「私でよければ、剣術を教えて差し上げましょうか？」</sup><br><sup>"If you don't mind me, shall I teach you swordsmanship?"</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">"What, are you sure?"<br><sup>「えっ、いいの！？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that's all right!"</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">She nodded to Colts, whose eyes sparkled with surprise and anticipation.<br><sup>驚きと期待に瞳を輝かせるコルツに、彼女は頷く。</sup><br><sup>She nods to Colts, whose eyes sparkle with surprise and expectation.</sup></p>
<p id="L70"><br></p>
<p id="L71">"You want to be able to use a sword, don't you?　It's not the same form as theirs, but I can still teach you if you want."<br><sup>「剣が使えるようになりたいのでしょう？　彼女たちのような形とは違いますが、それでもよければお教えしますよ」</sup><br><sup>"You want to be able to use swords, don't you?"It's different from their shapes, but if you don't mind, I'll tell you."</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">She said, setting the basket down and drawing her sword.<br><sup>彼女はそう言うと、カゴを下ろして剣を抜いた。</sup><br><sup>When she said so, she lowered the basket and drew her sword.</sup></p>
<p id="L74"><br></p>
<p id="L75">"'Let's start with the basic form. Try to imitate me."<br><sup>「まずは基本の形から始めましょう。私の真似をしてください」</sup><br><sup>"Let's start with the basic form.Please imitate me."</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">Grasping the hilt of the sword with both hands, draw your right arm with the tip of the sword pointing above your head, so that the sword is raised in front of your chest.<br><sup>両手で剣の柄を握り、剣先を頭上に向けて右腕を引き、胸の前で剣を掲げるようにする。</sup><br><sup>Hold the handle of the sword with both hands, pull your right arm with the tip of the sword facing overhead, and raise the sword in front of your chest.</sup></p>
<p id="L78">Standing diagonally with the left half of his body in front of him, he opened his legs wide, bent his knees slightly, and sat back.<br><sup>左半身を前にして斜めに立ち、足を大きく開いて少し膝を曲げて腰を落とした。</sup><br><sup>He stood diagonally with his left half facing forward, opened his legs wide, bent his knees slightly, and sat down.</sup></p>
<p id="L79"><br></p>
<p id="L80">"Okay. Just be aware of lowering your center of gravity. ...... What's wrong?"<br><sup>「いいですか。重心を下げるように意識して……どうしました？」</sup><br><sup>"Look, I'm conscious of lowering my center of gravity... what's the matter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">She tilted her head at Kolz, who was staring at her with an indescribable expression.<br><sup>何ともいえない表情で見つめてくるコルツに、彼女は首を傾げた。</sup><br><sup>She tilted her head to Coltz, who stared at her with an indescribable expression.</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">"The way you're holding yourself, it's kind of uncool. ......<br><sup>「その構え方、何だか格好悪い……」</sup><br><sup>"That posture is kind of ugly..."</sup></p>
<p id="L85"><br></p>
<p id="L86">"I'll teach you how to set up a cool stance later at ....... Now, get ready."<br><sup>「……後で格好いい構え方も教えます。さあ、構えてください」</sup><br><sup>"...I'll teach you how to stand cool later.Now, hold on."</sup></p>
<p id="L87"><br></p>
<p id="L88">At her urging, Colts hurriedly readied his stick.<br><sup>彼女に促され、コルツは慌てて棒を構える。</sup><br><sup>At her urging, Colts hastily holds up his stick.</sup></p>
<p id="L89">Once she lowered her sword, she walked over to Kolz and put her hand on his back.<br><sup>彼女は一旦剣を下ろすと、コルツに歩み寄って背中に手を添えた。</sup><br><sup>Once she lowered her sword, she walked up to Colts and put her hand on his back.</sup></p>
<p id="L90"><br></p>
<p id="L91">"My spine is crooked. It's like I've got a single stick through my back. ...... at ......"<br><sup>「背筋が曲がっています。背中に一本棒を通したような感じ……で……」</sup><br><sup>"My spine is bent.It feels like I've put a stick through my back... and..."</sup></p>
<p id="L92"><br></p>
<p id="L93">"What's wrong?"<br><sup>「どうしたの？」</sup><br><sup>"What's the matter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L94"><br></p>
<p id="L95">As soon as he touched her body, she suddenly choked on her words, and Colts tilted his head.<br><sup>身体に触れた途端、急に言葉を詰まらせた彼女に、コルツは首を傾げた。</sup><br><sup>As soon as he touched her, Colts tilted his head to her, who suddenly choked.</sup></p>
<p id="L96"><br></p>
<p id="L97">"...... No. Yes, the hands are in that position. Your feet should be wider."<br><sup>「……いえ。そう、手はその位置です。足の幅はもっと広げましょう」</sup><br><sup>"...no. Yes, your hands are in that position.Let's widen our legs."</sup></p>

<p id="L100"><br></p>

<p id="L103">When the area is tinged with the color of sunset.<br><sup>辺りが夕焼け色に染まる頃。</sup><br><sup>It's about the time when it turns sunset.</sup></p>
<p id="L104">She taught Colt how to wield and receive the sword, and then put it back in its sheath.<br><sup>彼女は剣の振るいかたや受けかたなどをコルツに一通り教えると、剣を鞘に戻した。</sup><br><sup>She taught Colts how to wield and receive the sword, and put it back in its sheath.</sup></p>
<p id="L105"><br></p>
<p id="L106">"I don't know if this is correct. I don't know if this is the right way to do it, because I've only seen others do it.<br><sup>「だいたいこのような形です。私も人がやっているのを見ていただけなので、これが正しいのかは分かりませんけど」</sup><br><sup>"It's roughly like this.I was just watching people do it, so I don't know if this is right."</sup></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">"Wait!　Don't say that after I've taught you this much!"<br><sup>「ちょっ！？　ここまで教えておいてそんなこと言うなよ！」</sup><br><sup>"Hey!? Don't say that after telling me this!"</sup></p>
<p id="L109"><br></p>
<p id="L110">She says something outrageous after a lot of instruction, and Colt leaks his frustration.<br><sup>しこたま指導した後でとんでもないことを言う彼女に、コルツが不満の声を漏らす。</sup><br><sup>Colts complains to her, who says something outrageous after much instruction.</sup></p>

<p id="L112"><br></p>
<p id="L113">"It's probably fine. It should be about right."<br><sup>「たぶん大丈夫ですよ。だいたい合っているはずですから」</sup><br><sup>"Perhaps it is all right.It should be pretty much right."</sup></p>
<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115">With that, he offered the basket to Colts.<br><sup>そう言って、カゴをコルツに差し出した。</sup><br><sup>said he, holding out his basket to Colts.</sup></p>
<p id="L116"><br></p>
<p id="L117">"I'll give you this. Is this enough for you?"<br><sup>「これを差し上げます。これだけあれば足りますか？」</sup><br><sup>"I'll give you this.Is this all you need?"</sup></p>
<p id="L118"><br></p>
<p id="L119">"It's enough, but ...... yeah, how do you know that?"<br><sup>「足りるけど……え、何で知ってるの？」</sup><br><sup>"It's enough, but... how do you know?"</sup></p>
<p id="L120"><br></p>
<p id="L121">Before coming here, Colts' mother had asked him to gather mushrooms and nuts in the nearby forest.<br><sup>コルツはここに来る前、母親から近くの森でキノコと木の実を採ってくるように頼まれていた。</sup><br><sup>Colts had been asked by his mother to gather mushrooms and nuts in a nearby forest before he came here.</sup></p>
<p id="L122">However, since she had taught me sword fighting and I hadn't done any gathering, I was naturally empty-handed.<br><sup>だが、彼女から剣術を教わっていて一切採集を行っていなかったので、当然のごとく手ぶらである。</sup><br><sup>However, since she had taught me swordsmanship and had not collected anything, it was natural that she was empty-handed.</sup></p>
<p id="L123">Lately, he had been doing a lot of sword fighting, and he hadn't done much collecting, and he was scolded every time he came home.<br><sup>最近はいつも言いつけそっちのけで剣術の真似事をしていたためにほとんど採集をしておらず、帰るたびに叱られていた。</sup><br><sup>Recently, I have been ignoring orders and imitating swordsmanship, so I have rarely collected them, and I have been scolded every time I go home.</sup></p>
<p id="L124"><br></p>
<p id="L125">"You have to listen to your mother and father. Next time, let's do some foraging before we practice."<br><sup>「お父さんとお母さんの言うことは聞かないとダメです。次からは採集をしてから練習しましょうね」</sup><br><sup>"You have to listen to your mother and father.Let's practice after collecting next time."</sup></p>
<p id="L126"><br></p>
<p id="L127">She gave an off-key answer and smiled, patting Colt's head gently.<br><sup>彼女はずれた答えを返すと、コルツの頭を優しく撫でて微笑んだ。</sup><br><sup>She returned a wrong answer and patted Colts gently on the head and smiled.</sup></p>
<p id="L128"><br></p>
<p id="L129">"The sun is about to set. You should go home for the day."<br><sup>「そろそろ日が落ちます。今日はもう帰りなさい」</sup><br><sup>"The sun is setting.You must go home to-day."</sup></p>
<p id="L130"><br></p>
<p id="L131">"Yeah ...... can you tell me tomorrow?"<br><sup>「うん……明日も教えてくれる？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes... Can you tell me again tomorrow?"</sup></p>
<p id="L132"><br></p>

<p id="L134"><br></p>
<p id="L135">"Yes!　Absolutely, right?"<br><sup>「やった！　絶対だよ？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes! Absolutely!"</sup></p>
<p id="L136"><br></p>
<p id="L137">She laughed at Colts, who jumped up and down with joy.<br><sup>飛び上がって喜ぶコルツに、彼女は苦笑した。</sup><br><sup>She smiled bitterly at Colts, who jumped up and rejoiced.</sup></p>
<p id="L138"><br></p>
<p id="L139">"I'll keep my promise. Look, if you don't come home soon, your parents will be worried."<br><sup>「約束は守りますよ。ほら、早く帰らないとご両親が心配しますよ」</sup><br><sup>"I'll keep my word.Look, if you don't go home early, your parents will be worried."</sup></p>
<p id="L140"><br></p>
<p id="L141">With her back to him, Colts started walking towards home.<br><sup>彼女に背中を押され、コルツは家へと向かって歩き出した。</sup><br><sup>She pushed him on the back and Colts started walking home.</sup></p>
<p id="L142"><br></p>
<p id="L143">"Oh, yeah. Your sister's name is ...... that?"<br><sup>「あ、そうだ。お姉ちゃんの名前……あれ？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that's right. Your name... Huh?"</sup></p>
<p id="L144"><br></p>
<p id="L145">Realizing that he hadn't heard her name yet, Kolz turned around.<br><sup>まだ彼女の名前を聞いていなかったことに気づき、コルツは振り返った。</sup><br><sup>When Colts realized that he had not heard her name yet, he looked back.</sup></p>
<p id="L146">But there was no one there, just a forest tinged with the colors of the setting sun.<br><sup>だがそこには誰もおらず、夕焼け色に染まる森が広がるばかりだ。</sup><br><sup>But there was no one there, and the sunset-colored forest was spreading out.</sup></p>
<p id="L147">I looked around in panic, but I couldn't even see any sign of him.<br><sup>慌ててきょろきょろと辺りを見渡すが、気配すら感じられなかった。</sup><br><sup>I looked around in a hurry, but I couldn't even feel a sign.</sup></p>
<p id="L148">I raised my voice to call out to her, but her voice echoed in the forest and there was no reply.<br><sup>声を上げて彼女を呼ぶが、声は空しく森に響くばかりで返事は返ってこない。</sup><br><sup>I called her out, but her voice echoed hollowly through the woods and she didn't reply.</sup></p>
<p id="L149"><br></p>
<p id="L150">"...... Oh, my God. Maybe he's a god, too. How many people are there?"<br><sup>「……え、嘘だろ。もしかして、あの人も神様かよ。いったい何人いるんだよ」</sup><br><sup>"...oh, you're lying.Maybe he's a god, too.How many people are there?"</sup></p>

<p id="L225">It was a little chilly, but they both agreed that this was better than a private carriage because they could see more of their surroundings.<br><sup>少し肌寒いが、周囲がよく見えるので個室型の馬車よりもこちらのほうがいいという意見で２人は一致していた。</sup><br><sup>It was a little chilly, but they agreed that this was better than a private carriage because they could see the surroundings well.</sup></p>

<p id="L227">The ride is much more comfortable than the old style carriages, but only a few have been made yet due to low production priority, and the technology has not spread to the general population.<br><sup>旧式の馬車に比べて乗り心地は格段にいいのだが、生産の優先順位が低いためにまだ数台しか作られておらず、一般層にまでは技術が普及していない。</sup><br><sup>Although it is much more comfortable to ride than old-fashioned horse-drawn carts, only a few cars have been made due to low production priorities, and technology has not spread to the general public.</sup></p>

<p id="L234"><br></p>
<p id="L235">There was an incident when I was giving instructions for fertilizer spreading in the granary, and even those who did not speak the language of the country could understand the words of Ichiran.<br><sup>以前、穀倉地帯で肥料散布の作業指示を出していた時に、一良の言葉をこの国の言葉を話せない者までが理解できたといった出来事があった。</sup><br><sup>In the past, when instructions were given for fertilizer spraying in the granary area, even those who could not speak the language of this country could understand Ichira's language.</sup></p>
<p id="L236">Since the source of the rumor must be those people, I can see how the rumor could spread that the resurrection of the grain fields was Gracior's doing.<br><sup>噂の出所はその者たちであるはずなので、穀倉地帯の復活がグレイシオールの行いだとして噂が広まるのは分かる。</sup><br><sup>They should be the sources of the rumor, so we can see that the resurrection of the granary is the act of Graciol.</sup></p>
<p id="L237">However, it was unexpected that even the development of the waterwheel was supposed to have originated from Gracieol.<br><sup>だが、水車の開発までがグレイシオール発であるということになっているのは予想外だった。</sup><br><sup>However, it was unexpected that the development of the waterwheel was supposed to start from Graciol.</sup></p>

<p id="L243">"But doesn't it seem strange that the god of mercy and fertility would teach us how to build a water mill?　I can understand if there are rumors that it's the work of a god of technology or knowledge, but..."<br><sup>「でも、慈悲と豊穣の神様が水車の作り方を教えるっていう話は違和感がないか？　もっとこう、技術とか知識の神様の行いだって噂が立つなら分かるけどさ」</sup><br><sup>"But isn't it uncomfortable to hear that the god of mercy and fertility teaches how to make a waterwheel?I understand if there is a rumor that it is the act of the god of technology and knowledge."</sup></p>

<p id="L273">As we walked side by side, our eyes naturally fell on Kazuyoshi, and we could see people whispering to each other here and there.<br><sup>並んで歩く一良にも自然と視線は集まり、あちこちで何やらひそひそと話している人びとの姿が視界に入る。</sup><br><sup>Ichira, who walks side by side, naturally attracts attention, and you can see people whispering here and there.</sup></p>

<p id="L275">"Speaking of which, are you going to make fire bricks so that Isteria can make them?"<br><sup>「そういえば、耐火レンガはイステリアでも作れるようにするの？」</sup><br><sup>"Come to think of it, can firebricks be made in the exterior?"</sup></p>
<p id="L276"><br></p>
<p id="L277">"That's the plan. I'm also thinking of building a special brick kiln for more efficient production.<br><sup>「そのつもり。せっかくだから、生産効率がいい特殊なレンガ窯も作ろうかと思ってる」</sup><br><sup>"That's what I'm going to do. I'm thinking of making a special brick kiln with high production efficiency."</sup></p>
<p id="L278"><br></p>
<p id="L279">"Oh, I didn't know there was such a thing. What does it look like?"<br><sup>「へえ、そんなのがあるんだ。どんな形してるの？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, there is such a thing.What does it look like?"</sup></p>
<p id="L280"><br></p>
<p id="L281">"The kiln is called a climbing kiln. It's called a climbing kiln, and it can fire a lot of bricks and earthenware at once, and it requires less fuel. Of course, it can also be used for charcoal burning.<br><sup>「さっきの工房にあったような窯を、坂道に段々に設置して連結したような形かな。登り窯っていう窯で、一度にたくさんレンガとか土器を焼けるし、燃料も少なくて済むんだよ。もちろん炭焼きにも使えるぞ」</sup><br><sup>"It's like installing kilns in stages on a slope like the one in the workshop earlier.It's a kiln called a climbing kiln that burns a lot of bricks and earthenware at once, and requires less fuel.Of course it can be used for charcoal grilling."</sup></p>
<p id="L282"><br></p>
<p id="L283">A climbing kiln is a kiln that is shaped like a kamakura, with several kilns connected in tiers.<br><sup>登り窯とは、かまくらのような形の窯を段にして何個も連結した形状の窯だ。</sup><br><sup>Climbing kilns are kilns that are shaped like kamakura and are connected in layers.</sup></p>
<p id="L284">Since warm air has a tendency to rise to the top, it can be used to heat the upper kiln using the residual heat of the lower stage.<br><sup>温かい空気は上に昇る性質があるので、それを利用して下の段の余熱を使い、上部の窯を温めることができる。</sup><br><sup>Warm air has the property of rising up, so it can be used to heat the upper kiln using the residual heat of the lower section.</sup></p>
<p id="L285">All kilns are equipped with an opening through which wood can be added to heat the kiln with residual heat, thus saving fuel.<br><sup>すべての窯には口がついており、そこから薪を追加して余熱で温まった窯を加熱できるので燃料の節約になる。</sup><br><sup>All kilns have mouths, from which firewood can be added to heat the kilns heated with residual heat, thus saving fuel.</sup></p>
<p id="L286">Naturally, the production efficiency is much higher than that of conventional kilns.<br><sup>当然、生産効率も従来の窯に比べれば段違いだ。</sup><br><sup>Of course, production efficiency is much different from that of conventional kilns.</sup></p>
<p id="L287"><br></p>
<p id="L288">"I see. Then we need to prepare a lot of materials for the bricks. We'll also have to prepare wood for charcoal.<br><sup>「そうなんだ。なら、レンガの材料をたくさん用意しておかないといけないね。炭にする木材も用意しておかないと」</sup><br><sup>"I see. Then I'll have to prepare a lot of brick materials.We must have some wood ready for charcoal."</sup></p>
<p id="L289"><br></p>
<p id="L290">It is now the end of November, and winter will soon be upon us.<br><sup>今は11月末であり、間もなく冬が訪れる。</sup><br><sup>It is the end of November and winter is coming soon.</sup></p>
<p id="L291">I remembered hearing before that the price of firewood goes up in the winter, but if we let it go up even higher from there, it would be a problem for the citizens.<br><sup>冬場は薪の価格が上がると以前聞いた覚えがあったが、そこからさらに高騰させてしまっては市民に迷惑をかけてしまう。</sup><br><sup>I remember hearing that the price of firewood rises in winter, but if it rises further, it will cause inconvenience to citizens.</sup></p>
<p id="L292">Large-scale purchases will have to be avoided, as they could put a damper on a market that has begun to regain its vitality due to lower food prices.<br><sup>食糧価格の低下で活気を取り戻し始めた市場に水を差しかねないので、大規模な買い付けは避けなければならないだろう。</sup><br><sup>Large-scale purchases should be avoided because they could put a damper on the market, which has begun to revive due to falling food prices.</sup></p>
<p id="L293">In a little while, Ichira will be returning to Japan, so she can buy a lot of charcoal at the home improvement store then.<br><sup>もうしばらくしたら一良は一旦日本に戻る予定なので、その時にホームセンターで炭を大量購入してしまってもいい。</sup><br><sup>Ichira plans to return to Japan in a little while, so you can buy a lot of charcoal at the home center then.</sup></p>
<p id="L294">If push came to shove, they could bring high-quality iron directly from Japan, but with four years to go before the deadline of the armistice agreement, Kazuyoshi thought there was no need to be in such a hurry.<br><sup>いざとなったら日本から高品質な鉄を直接持ってきてしまってもいいのだが、休戦協定の期限まで４年も猶予があるので、そこまで焦る必要はないと一良は考えていた。</sup><br><sup>In case of emergency, high-quality iron could be brought directly from Japan, but Ichira thought there was no need to be in such a hurry because there was a four-year delay until the armistice agreement was reached.</sup></p>
<p id="L295"><br></p>
<p id="L296">"I'm sure you're right. It's about to be winter, so the demand will increase, and we need to secure it as soon as possible. ...... Ah."<br><sup>「そうだな。そろそろ冬になるから需要も増えるだろうし、早めに確保しておかないといけないな……あ」</sup><br><sup>"Well, it's almost winter, so the demand will increase, and we have to secure it as soon as possible..."</sup></p>
<p id="L297"><br></p>
<p id="L298">"What's wrong?"<br><sup>「どうしたの？」</sup><br><sup>"What's the matter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L299"><br></p>
<p id="L300">Lise tilted her head slightly at Kazuyoshi, who suddenly remembered to speak up.<br><sup>ふと思い出したように声を上げた一良に、リーゼが小首を傾げる。</sup><br><sup>Liese tilts her head slightly at Ichira, who suddenly screams as if she remembered.</sup></p>
<p id="L301"><br></p>
<p id="L302">"About four months ago, the village of Grisea had a crop failure, so they decided to pay taxes on wood instead. I'm sure there are many other villages in the same situation, so from those villages, the tax will come in the form of wood, at least until next spring or summer, right?　We can use that to fuel our steel making and brick making.<br><sup>「４ヶ月くらい前の話なんだけどさ、グリセア村で作物が不作でどうにもならないから、代わりに木材を租税として納めるってことになったんだ。他にも同じ状態の農村がたくさんあるはずだから、それらの村からは少なくとも来年の春か夏までは租税は木材で入ってくるってことになるだろ？　それを製鉄とレンガ作りの燃料に回せばいいんじゃないかな」</sup><br><sup>"About four months ago, when the crops in the village of Glyceria were so poor that I couldn't do anything about it, so I decided to pay wood as a tax instead.There must be many other rural areas in the same condition, so taxes will come from those villages at least until next spring or summer, right?Why don't we turn it into steel and brick fuel?"</sup></p>
<p id="L303"><br></p>
<p id="L304">"Oh, I didn't know that was going on. Then we don't have to worry about firewood. Let's ask your father later how much is coming in.<br><sup>「へえ、そんなことになってたんだ。それなら、薪の心配はしなくてもよくなるね。どれくらい入ってきてるのか、後でお父様に聞いてみよっか」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that's what happened.Then you don't have to worry about firewood.Shall I ask your father how long he has come in?"</sup></p>
<p id="L305"><br></p>
<p id="L306">"Yes, let's do that. But I didn't think that the famine would have a useful effect. You never know where something might come into play."<br><sup>「うん、そうしよう。しかし、まさか飢饉の影響が役立つ方向に働くとは思わなかったな。どこで何が関係してくるのか分からないもんだ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I will.But I didn't expect the effects of famine to work in a useful direction.I don't know where and what's involved."</sup></p>
<p id="L307"><br></p>
<p id="L308">As they talked about this, the two of them swayed in the carriage to their next destination.<br><sup>そんな話をしながら、２人は馬車に揺られて次の目的地へと向かうのだった。</sup><br><sup>As they spoke, they were rocked to their next destination by a carriage.</sup></p>
