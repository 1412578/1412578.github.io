<p id="L1">After dinner that night.<br><sup>その日の夕食後。</sup><br><sup>After dinner that day.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">In a room where the dishes had been put away, Kazuyoshi was sitting with the Istair family over a cup of tea and a few potted plants.<br><sup>食器の片付けられた部屋で、一良はイステール一家とお茶を飲みながら数個の鉢植えを囲んでいた。</sup><br><sup>In the room where the dishes were tidied up, Ichira surrounded several potted plants over a cup of tea with the Istair family.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">The potted plants are medicinal herbs and saplings used for medicine, the same ones that the Sorcerer's Guild grows in the city.<br><sup>鉢植えの植物は薬に使われる薬草や苗木で、呪術師組合が街なかで栽培しているものと同じものだ。</sup><br><sup>Potted plants are medicinal herbs and saplings that are the same as those cultivated in the city by the sorcerer's association.</sup></p>
<p id="L4"><br></p>
<p id="L5">"This is a medicinal herb? It's not a very distinctive grass, is it? It looks like a weed.<br><sup>「これが薬草ですか。あまり特徴のある草じゃないんですね。雑草みたいな見た目というか」</sup><br><sup>"Is this a medicinal herb?"It's not a very characteristic grass, is it?It looks like a weed."</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">"Indeed, it's hard to tell at a glance. This herb has yellow flowers in the spring, so I often look for them. The one next to it bears red fruits in late autumn.<br><sup>「確かに、ぱっと見では分かりにくいですな。この薬草は春になると黄色い花を咲かせるので、それを目印に探すことが多いです。その隣のものは、晩秋になると赤い実を付けますな」</sup><br><sup>"It's certainly hard to tell at a glance.This herb blooms yellow in spring, so I often look for it as a landmark.Don't bear the red fruit next to it in late autumn."</sup></p>
<p id="L8"><br></p>
<p id="L9">There were dozens of medicinal herbs, and the best places to collect them were the rocky surfaces and sheer cliffs of the highlands.<br><sup>薬草は数十種類あり、採取できる場所は高地の岩肌や切り立った崖などが多いとのことだった。</sup><br><sup>There are dozens of herbs, many of which can be harvested on highland rocks and cliffs.</sup></p>
<p id="L10">Despite the fact that it grows in such a place, it is a poor plant and it is said to be quite difficult to bring it to the plains and increase its number.<br><sup>そんな場所に生えているにも関わらず貧弱な植物で、平地に持ってきて増やすことはかなり難しいらしい。</sup><br><sup>Even though it grows in such a place, it seems that it is very difficult to bring it to flat ground and increase it.</sup></p>
<p id="L11">The flowers and leaves are generally known for their medicinal properties when taken as they are, but the medicines made by the sorcerers were said to have a much different effect.<br><sup>一般的にそのまま花や葉を煎じて飲むと薬効があると知られているが、呪術師たちが作る薬は効能の具合が段違いとのことだった。</sup><br><sup>Generally speaking, it is known that it is effective to drink flowers or leaves directly, but the magicians make medicine with different effects.</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">"It looks kind of hard to grow. ...... How do the spellcasters do it?"<br><sup>「なんだか育て難そうですね……呪術師たちはどうやってるんでしょうか」</sup><br><sup>"It seems difficult to raise..."I wonder how the magicians are doing."</sup></p>
<p id="L14"><br></p>
<p id="L15">"'Maybe they're using a fertilizer like the one Kazura brought?　Or maybe they're making something similar to it themselves."<br><sup>「カズラが持ってきたような肥料を使っているんじゃない？　もしくは、それに近いものを自分たちで作ってるとか」</sup><br><sup>"Isn't it using fertilizer that Kazura brought?"Or we're making something similar to it ourselves."</sup></p>
<p id="L16"><br></p>
<p id="L17">Liese's words reminded Kazuyoshi of the "spell for a good harvest" he had heard from Baretta.<br><sup>リーゼの言葉に、一良は以前バレッタから聞いた『豊作のおまじない』を思い出した。</sup><br><sup>At Liese's words, Ichira remembered "The Magic of a Good Harvest" that she had heard from Valletta before.</sup></p>
<p id="L18">In the village of Grisea, they used to scatter crushed animal bones to pray for a good harvest.<br><sup>グリセア村では豊作祈願として、粉砕した動物の骨を撒いていたらしい。</sup><br><sup>It seems that crushed animal bones were sprinkled in the village of Glyceria as a prayer for a good harvest.</sup></p>
<p id="L19">In a world where there was not even a concept of fertilizer, I would be surprised if there were already people who were using it.<br><sup>肥料の概念すらなかったこの世界で、すでに肥料を使用していた者たちが存在していたとしたら驚きだが。</sup><br><sup>It would be surprising if there were people who had already used fertilizer in this world where there was no concept of fertilizer.</sup></p>
<p id="L20"><br></p>
<p id="L21">"But can you do it so well?"<br><sup>「でも、そんなに上手くできるものかしら？」</sup><br><sup>"But I wonder if I can do it so well?"</sup></p>
<p id="L22"><br></p>
<p id="L23">Zirconia tilted her head at Liese's words.<br><sup>リーゼの言葉に、ジルコニアが首を傾げた。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia tilted her head at Liese's words.</sup></p>
<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25">"I don't think I could make something like the fertilizer Kazura-san brought, and if I could, I'm sure I'd be working on something other than growing medicinal herbs.<br><sup>「カズラさんの持ってきた肥料みたいなものを作れるなんてとても思えないし、もし作れていたとしたら薬草の栽培以外にも手を出していると思うんだけど」</sup><br><sup>"I don't think I can make something like fertilizer that Kazura brought me, and if I could, I would have done anything other than cultivating herbs."</sup></p>
<p id="L26"><br></p>
<p id="L27">"I'm sure that's true, but if it's something less effective, you can make it. ...... Another way would be some kind of spell. The effect of the spell may be to stimulate the growth of the herb.<br><sup>「確かにそれはそうですが、効果の薄いものなら作れるとか……他の手段となると、なんらかの呪術でしょうか。まじないの効果で、薬草の成長をうながしているのかもしれません」</sup><br><sup>"That's true, but if it's less effective, it can be made... if it's any other means, is it some kind of magic?The magical effect may be encouraging the growth of herbs."</sup></p>
<p id="L28"><br></p>
<p id="L29">"Witchcraft. ...... Oh, what happened to your pendant?　Have I had it for a while?"<br><sup>「呪術ねえ……あら、そのペンダントどうしたの？　前から持ってたかしら？」</sup><br><sup>"What's wrong with that pendant?"Have you had it for a long time?"</sup></p>
<p id="L30"><br></p>
<p id="L31">"Oh, is that it?"<br><sup>「あ、これですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, this one?"</sup></p>
<p id="L32"><br></p>
<p id="L33">Zirconia suddenly caught sight of the gold pendant shining on Lise's chest.<br><sup>ジルコニアはふと、リーゼの胸元に輝いている金のペンダントに目を留めた。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia suddenly caught sight of a gold pendant shining on Liese's chest.</sup></p>
<p id="L34">Liese picks up the pendant and smiles as she looks at Ichiran.<br><sup>リーゼはペンダントをつまみ、一良に目を向けてにこりと微笑む。</sup><br><sup>Liese grabs the pendant and smiles at Ichira.</sup></p>
<p id="L35"><br></p>
<p id="L36">"Kazura bought it for me on the street today.<br><sup>「今日、街でカズラに買ってもらったんです」</sup><br><sup>"I had Kazura buy it for me on the street today."</sup></p>
<p id="L37"><br></p>
<p id="L38">"Oh, my God, you did. Good for you."<br><sup>「まあ、そうだったの。よかったわね」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I see. That's a relief."</sup></p>
<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">"Yes."<br><sup>「はい」</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L41"><br></p>
<p id="L42">"...... Hmm."<br><sup>「……ふむ」</sup><br><sup>"... well,"</sup></p>
<p id="L43"><br></p>
<p id="L44">Looking at the two happy people, Narson gave a small nod.<br><sup>嬉しそうにしている２人を眺め、ナルソンは小さく頷いた。</sup><br><sup>Looking at the two happily, Narson nodded slightly.</sup></p>
<p id="L45">On his face was written, "Is this what you want?<br><sup>その顔には「これはこれでいいか」と書いてあった。</sup><br><sup>The face said, "Is this all right?"</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">"Well, let's see, spell casting aside, let's try some things. First, let's try fertilizing it and see if we can increase its growth."<br><sup>「え、ええと、呪術はともかくとして、色々と試してみましょうか。まずは肥料を与えてみて、増やすことができるか調べるってことで」</sup><br><sup>"Well, let's see, apart from magic, shall we try various things?First of all, I'll give him fertilizer and see if he can increase it."</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">"I suppose so. If we can successfully increase it, we can use it to explore methods of cultivating like the sorcerers."<br><sup>「そうですね。上手く増やせたら、それを使って呪術師たちのように栽培できる手法を探ってみましょう」</sup><br><sup>"Well, if you can increase it well, let's find a way to grow it like magicians."</sup></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51">"Well, that sounds like a good idea. That would be a good time to try the spell."<br><sup>「うむ、それがよさそうですな。呪術を試すのもその時でいいでしょう」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that sounds good.You can try magic then."</sup></p>
<p id="L52"><br></p>
<p id="L53">So we talked about it and decided to grow medicinal herbs.<br><sup>そんなこんなで話はまとまり、薬草を栽培することになった。</sup><br><sup>This led to the settlement of the matter and the cultivation of medicinal herbs.</sup></p>
<p id="L54">The medicinal herbs were to be grown on the roof of the mansion, as they were poor and would be better separated from other plants.<br><sup>薬草は貧弱なので他の植物とは離したほうがいいだろうということで、屋敷の屋上で栽培されることになった。</sup><br><sup>The herbs were poor and should be separated from other plants, so they were grown on the roof of the house.</sup></p>
<p id="L55">When we find a good method of cultivation without using Japanese fertilizers, we will offer our cooperation to the sorcerer's union with the information as a souvenir.<br><sup>日本の肥料を使わずに上手い栽培の手法が見つかった暁には、その情報を手土産に呪術師組合に協力を申し出る予定だ。</sup><br><sup>When they find a good method of cultivation without using Japanese fertilizer, they will use the information as a souvenir and ask the sorcerer's union for cooperation.</sup></p>
<p id="L56">They claimed to have mass-produced it using existing methods, but in fact they used Japanese fertilizers to increase production and asked the sorcerers' guild to refine the medicine.<br><sup>既存のやり方で大量生産したとうそぶいて、実際は日本の肥料も使って増産し、呪術師組合に薬の精製を依頼するという寸法である。</sup><br><sup>In fact, Japanese fertilizers will be used to increase production, and the magician's union will be asked to refine the medicine.</sup></p>
<p id="L57"><br></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59"><br></p>
<p id="L60">"What, the maid's uniform has that effect?<br><sup>「えっ、侍女服ってそんな効果があるんですか！？」</sup><br><sup>"What, does the maid's dress have that effect?"</sup></p>
<p id="L61"><br></p>
<p id="L62">"That's true if you're buying groceries or supplies. The story goes that it's quicker if you're wearing a maidservant's uniform, and you should be able to get a discount if you hire yourself and give the name of your former family."<br><sup>「食料品や消耗品を買う場合はそうですね。侍女服を着ていれば手っ取り早いという話で、自ら雇われ元の家名を名乗れば割引してもらえるはずです」</sup><br><sup>"That's true when you buy groceries and consumables.They say it's easy to get a discount if you wear a maid's dress, and if you hire yourself and name your family name, you'll get a discount."</sup></p>
<p id="L63"><br></p>
<p id="L64">The next day at noon, Kazuyoshi rented a table at a restaurant in town and had dinner with Alondo.<br><sup>翌日の昼、一良は街なかの飲食店のテーブルを１つ借り、アロンドと食事をとっていた。</sup><br><sup>The next day, Ichira rented a table at a restaurant in the city and had dinner with Alondo.</sup></p>
<p id="L65">He was visiting the workshop near noon when he happened to pass by, heard about it, and invited Kazuyoshi to dinner.<br><sup>昼近くに工房を訪れていた際、たまたま付近を通った彼がそれを聞きつけて、一良を食事に誘ったからだ。</sup><br><sup>When he was visiting the workshop near noon, he happened to hear it and invited Ichira to dinner.</sup></p>
<p id="L66">What Kazuyoshi is eating is a hot sandwich (the wheat and ingredients are made in Japan) that Marie prepared for him in the morning.<br><sup>一良の食べているものは、朝のうちにマリーが用意してくれたホットサンド（小麦と具材は日本製）である。</sup><br><sup>Ichira is eating hot sandwiches (wheat and ingredients made in Japan) prepared by Marie in the morning.</sup></p>
<p id="L67">Currently, Marie is not here as she is supervising the work elsewhere.<br><sup>現在、マリーは別の場所で作業監督をしているため、この場にはいない。</sup><br><sup>Currently, Marie is not here because she is supervising the work elsewhere.</sup></p>
<p id="L68">Arondo is eating a sandwich with thinly sliced meat, which he ordered at the restaurant.<br><sup>アロンドは店で注文した、薄焼きの肉を挟んだサンドイッチを食べている。</sup><br><sup>Alondo is eating sandwiches with grilled meat that he ordered at the store.</sup></p>
<p id="L69"><br></p>
<p id="L70">"The servants who do the shopping are in charge of all the shopping, they buy a lot, and the choice of store depends on their mood. Even if the store makes a little less money, it's a big help if they become our customers. The servants get a little pocket money from the difference in price, so it's a win-win situation.<br><sup>「買出しをする使用人は買い物内容を一任されているうえに購入量が多く、しかも店の選定はその者の気分次第です。店としては多少儲けが少なくなっても、お得意さんになってもらえれば大助かりなんですよ。使用人たちは値引きされた差額から小遣いをちょろまかせますから、持ちつ持たれつの関係ですね」</sup><br><sup>"A shopper is entrusted with the shopping content and has a large amount of purchases, and the choice of a store depends on his mood.Even if the store makes a little less money, it would be a great help if you could be a customer.The servants depend on the difference in the discounted amount of pocket money, so it's a matter of whether you have it or not."</sup></p>
<p id="L71"><br></p>
<p id="L72">As soon as he sat down, Kazuyoshi asked him about the recent dealings with the Gregorian territory, thinking that Arondo would be familiar with the market.<br><sup>一良は席について早々、アロンドならば市場にも詳しいだろうと、最近のグレゴルン領との取引の状況について彼に尋ねた。</sup><br><sup>As soon as he sat down, Ichira asked him about the recent transactions with Gregorne, saying that Alondo would be familiar with the market.</sup></p>
<p id="L73">He answered our questions easily and even shared his views on the food prices in Gregorian territory and the general public's willingness to buy.<br><sup>彼はすらすらと問いに答え、グレゴルン領の食料価格の推移や一般市民の購買意欲の見解まで話してくれた。</sup><br><sup>He answered the questions smoothly and even expressed his views on food prices in Gregorian territory and the willingness of ordinary citizens to buy.</sup></p>
<p id="L74"><br></p>
<p id="L75">I also asked him about the bad weather along the coast of Gregorian territory, and he said he had heard about it too.<br><sup>グレゴルン領沿岸の天候不順についても聞いてみたのだが、彼もその話は聞いているとのことだった。</sup><br><sup>I also heard about the inclement weather along the Gregorian coast, and he said he had heard of it.</sup></p>
<p id="L76">It seems that his father, Noor, is the main person in charge of the salt trade, and he will ask him more about it next time.<br><sup>塩取引の主担当は父親のノールが行っているらしく、今度詳しく聞いておいてくれるそうだ。</sup><br><sup>It seems that his father, Noor, is in charge of the salt trade, and he will ask him in detail next time.</sup></p>
<p id="L77">Now the conversation has shifted to things like "how to buy things cheaply" and he is explaining his business know-how to Ichiran.<br><sup>今は話の流れから、『物を安く買う方法』といったものに話題が移り、彼が商売のノウハウを一良に説明している状態だ。</sup><br><sup>Now, the topic of conversation has shifted from "how to buy things cheaply," and he is explaining his know-how in business.</sup></p>
<p id="L78"><br></p>
<p id="L79">"I'm not sure what to say. I'm not sure what to make of it.　I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that.<br><sup>「な、なるほど。侍女服を着ていればどこかの使いだとすぐに分かりますもんね……でも、差額をちょろまかすなんて、雇い主にばれたら大変なんじゃないですか？　帳簿からばれたりしないんですかね？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I see.If you wear court ladies' clothes, you'll find out right away that you're an errand girl... but wouldn't it be hard for your employer to find out the difference?Don't you think it's going to be found out from the books?"</sup></p>
<p id="L80"><br></p>
<p id="L81">"I'm sure you'll be able to understand why. In the event that you have any questions regarding where and how to use the site, please do not hesitate to contact us.<br><sup>「そうですね……年数が経ってくると使用人もだんだん大胆になってきて、ちょろまかし方が雑になってきますね。いくらなんでもそれはガメすぎだろという事例も稀に見受けられます」</sup><br><sup>"Well... as the years go by, the servants become bolder and the way they play around becomes messy.It's rare to see that it's too much of a turtle, no matter how much it is."</sup></p>
<p id="L82"><br></p>
<p id="L83">"Do you still fire people when that happens?<br><sup>「そういう時はやっぱりクビにするんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Do you fire him in such a case?"</sup></p>
<p id="L84"><br></p>
<p id="L85">"If the amount was too large, he would be handed over to the government officials for trial. Some of them made a secret book of accounts and spent a lot of money behind their masters' backs. When a servant they had tamed asked them how they had so much money, one of them said, 'If you could hold a quill, you would know how to make money.<br><sup>「額が大きければ役人に引き渡して裁判ですね。中には裏帳簿を作って主人に隠れて豪遊したあげく、<ruby><rb>手懐</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>てなず</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>けた使用人に『よくこんなにお金がありますね』と聞かれて、『お前も羽ペンを持つようになれば、金の作り方が分かるだろう』という名言を残した大物もいます」</sup><br><sup>"If the amount is large, it will be handed over to the official and tried.Some of them made a secret account book, hid from their master, and when a servant asked them, 'How can you make so much money?' they said, 'If you have a feather pen, you'll know how to make money.'</sup></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">"Ugh, that's one hell of a servant ......."<br><sup>「うげ、それはとんでもない使用人ですね……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's a terrible servant..."</sup></p>
<p id="L88"><br></p>
<p id="L89">"I don't like it when they do that much, but I think it's a necessary expense if they're just skimming off a few bucks. And when I feel that they are getting a little carried away, I say to them, "You seem to be increasing your savings. When I feel that these people are getting a little carried away, I say to them, "It looks like your savings account has been growing lately. Have you gotten something you want? And they're usually surprisingly serious.<br><sup>「そこまでやられると困りますが、２アル３アルといった小額をちょろまかすくらいなら必要経費だと私は思っています。そして、そういった者たちが少し調子に乗ってきたなと感じたら、こう言うのです。『最近買い出し貯金の額が増えてきたようだが、何か欲しいものでもできたのか？』と。すると、たいていの場合は驚くほど真面目になりますよ』</sup><br><sup>"It would be a problem if they did that, but I think it would be a necessary expense to make a small amount of money, such as two or three.and when they feel a little carried away, they say,"It seems that the amount of savings you save has increased recently, but have you done anything you want?"Then, most of the time, you'll be surprisingly serious."</sup></p>
<p id="L90"><br></p>
<p id="L91">"I see, that makes me shudder."<br><sup>「なるほど、それは震え上がりますね」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that shakes me,"</sup></p>
<p id="L92"><br></p>
<p id="L93">Instead of scolding him right away, he seems to be saving it as a threat for later.<br><sup>すぐに叱りつけるのではなく、後々のための脅し文句としてとっておくということのようだ。</sup><br><sup>Instead of scolding them right away, they seem to be saving them as threats for future generations.</sup></p>
<p id="L94">I guess there's always a good time to use everything.<br><sup>何ごとも、使う好機というものがあるのだろう。</sup><br><sup>There must be an opportunity to use everything.</sup></p>
<p id="L95"><br></p>
<p id="L96">"I understand that such servants have an advantage in shopping, but what about ordinary citizens?<br><sup>「そういった使用人たちが買い物で有利なのは分かりましたが、普通の市民の場合はどうなんです？」</sup><br><sup>"I understand that these servants have an advantage in shopping, but what about ordinary citizens?"</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">"In the case of ordinary citizens, it's different. In the case of housewives, they have their own information network, so just because you give them a discount at the time doesn't mean they'll patronize you.<br><sup>「一般市民の場合はまた違います。子どもの使いではまず値引きはききませんし、主婦の場合は彼女たち独自の情報網があるので、その時値引きしてあげたからといって贔屓にしてくれるとは限りません」</sup><br><sup>"Not in the case of ordinary citizens.Children's errands don't give discounts, and housewives have their own information network, so giving them a discount doesn't necessarily mean they'll like it."</sup></p>
<p id="L99"><br></p>
<p id="L100">"So the stores change their behavior depending on the clientele."<br><sup>「客層によって店側は対応を変えるんですね」</sup><br><sup>"Depending on the customer base, the store will change its response."</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">"Yes, they are very serious about price and quality. However, if you don't discount too much for housewives, they will collude with you and no one will stick around, so the store will go out of business. It's better to give a little bit of a discount or an extra discount at the right time.<br><sup>「ええ、彼女たちは値段と品質にシビアですからね。かといって主婦相手にあまりにも値引きしないと、結託されて誰も寄り付かなくなるので店が潰れてしまいます。適度に頃合を見計らってちょこちょこ値引きしたり、おまけをするのがよいでしょう」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, they are strict about price and quality, but if you don't give housewives too much discount, they will collude and no one will come to you, so the shop will go bankrupt.It's better to give them a discount or give them a free gift at the right time."</sup></p>
<p id="L103"><br></p>
<p id="L104">"It's hard to sell something, isn't it? You even have to play psychological games. ......"<br><sup>「物を売るって大変なんですね。心理戦までしないといけないのか……」</sup><br><sup>"It's hard to sell things, isn't it?Do I even have to fight a psychological war?"</sup></p>
<p id="L105"><br></p>
<p id="L106">"It's not only for the customers who come to buy, but also for the customers who come to sell. For example, if a customer from a distant village comes to sell quality firewood, we buy it from him at the highest possible price. If we make a good impression on them, they will tell their friends about it when they return home.<br><sup>「買いにきた客だけでなく、売りにきた客に対してもそうですよ。例えば遠くの村から品質のいい薪を売りにきた者には、ギリギリまで高い値段で買い取ってあげるんです。次も優先して売りに来てくれるかもしれませんし、いい印象を与えておけば、そのお客は地元に戻ってから仲間にその出来事を話して聞かせます」</sup><br><sup>"Not only for customers who come to buy, but also for customers who come to sell.For example, those who come to sell high-quality firewood from a distant village will buy it at a very high price.Maybe they'll come and sell it to us next time, and if they make a good impression, they'll tell their friends about it when they get back to their hometown."</sup></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">"Are you saying that those who heard the story might stop by the store the next time they're in town?"<br><sup>「話を聞いた者たちが次に街に来た時に、店に寄ってくれるかもしれないってことですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Do you mean that the next time they come to town, they may stop by the shop?"</sup></p>
<p id="L109"><br></p>
<p id="L110">"That's right. When you set up store and do business, these methods are quite important."<br><sup>「そのとおりです。店を構えて商売をする上では、こういった手法はかなり重要です」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, sir.These methods are very important for opening a store and doing business."</sup></p>
<p id="L111"><br></p>
<p id="L112">Hearing this, Kazuyoshi remembered the time when he had sold firewood in the city with Baretta and the others.<br><sup>その話を聞き、一良は以前バレッタたちと一緒に街で薪を売った時のことを思い出した。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira heard the story, he remembered the time when he sold firewood in the street with the Valletas.</sup></p>
<p id="L113">There was one store that bought it for 1 al more than the others, but I guess this was the intention behind their response.<br><sup>他の店よりも１アル高く買い取ってくれた店があったが、あの時の対応はこういった意図があってのことだったのだろう。</sup><br><sup>There were shops that bought it one al higher than other stores, but I guess this was the reason why they handled it.</sup></p>
<p id="L114">I had a vague idea that he was a kind shopkeeper, but after hearing Alondo's story, I was convinced that he was.<br><sup>優しい店主だな、と何となく思っていたが、アロンドの話を聞いて「なるほど」と納得した。</sup><br><sup>I thought he was a kind shopkeeper, but when I heard Alondo's story, I was convinced.</sup></p>

<p id="L245">"It's nice. It could become a major industry.<br><sup>「いいですねえ。一大産業になったりして」</sup><br><sup>"Very well.It's going to be a big industry."</sup></p>
<p id="L246"><br></p>
<p id="L247">"I think that if we opened an ice cream shop, it would be a huge success. It would be a dream come true to be able to eat cold ice in the middle of summer.<br><sup>「カキ氷屋さんを出したら大繁盛すると思いますよ。真夏に冷たい氷が食べられるなんて、夢のようですから」</sup><br><sup>"If you open a shaved ice shop, it will be very prosperous.It's like a dream to be able to eat cold ice in the middle of summer."</sup></p>

<p id="L250">Kazuyoshi brought up the topics of shaved ice and cold udon noodles, and Zirconia seemed to be very interested.<br><sup>その中でカキ氷や冷やしうどんといった話題を一良が出したのだが、ジルコニアは興味津々の様子だった。</sup><br><sup>Among them, Ichira mentioned topics such as shaved ice and cold udon, but zirconia seemed to be very interested.</sup></p>
<p id="L251">When I explained to him that it was like eating fruit soup boiled down and poured over snow, his eyes lit up.<br><sup>特にカキ氷に心ときめくものがあったらしく、『果物を煮詰めて作った汁を雪にかけて食べるようなもの』と説明すると瞳を輝かせていた。</sup><br><sup>In particular, there was something exciting about shaved ice, and his eyes sparkled when he explained, "It's like eating soup made by boiling fruit in snow."</sup></p>
<p id="L252"><br></p>
<p id="L253">Incidentally, there are no noodles in this world, but there are gnocchi-like dishes made of boiled bread wheat.<br><sup>ちなみに、こちらの世界には麺類はないらしく、パン麦を練って茹でたニョッキのようなものはあるとのことだ。</sup><br><sup>Incidentally, there seems to be no noodles in this world, and there is something like nyokki made by kneading bread and boiling it.</sup></p>

<p id="L255">"So when I get home, I'm going to get some shaved ice from ....... Do I need an ice machine?<br><sup>「じゃあ、帰ったらカキ氷を……って、カキ氷機が必要か」</sup><br><sup>"Then, do you need a shaved ice machine when you get home?"</sup></p>
<p id="L256"><br></p>
<p id="L257">I can make ice with the ice maker in my refrigerator, but I don't have a shaved ice machine on hand.<br><sup>冷蔵庫の製氷機で氷は作れるが、カキ氷機が手元にない。</sup><br><sup>I can make ice with an ice machine in the refrigerator, but I don't have a shaved ice machine.</sup></p>

<p id="L259">I know that oyster ice was available in Japan long ago, but I wonder how they shaved the hard ice when there were no oyster machines.<br><sup>大昔の日本でもカキ氷はあったということは知っているのだが、カキ氷機がなかった当時は、いったいどうやって硬い氷を削っていたのだろうか。</sup><br><sup>I know there was shaved ice in Japan a long time ago, but how on earth did they shave hard ice when there was no shaved ice machine?</sup></p>
<p id="L260"><br></p>
<p id="L261">"Do I need a special tool?"<br><sup>「専用の道具が必要なのですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Do you need any special tools?"</sup></p>
<p id="L262"><br></p>
<p id="L263">"Yes, I have a tool that presses down on ice to scrape it off, but I want to make that too. The structure is simple, so let's make it later.<br><sup>「ええ、氷を押さえつけてごりごり削る道具があるんですけど、それも作りたいですね。構造は簡単なんで、後で作ってみましょう」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I have a tool to hold down the ice and grind it, but I want to make it, too.The structure is simple, so let's make it later."</sup></p>

<p id="L265">"So we'll have to wait until next year. I'm looking forward to it now."<br><sup>「では、来年までのお楽しみですね。今から楽しみです」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I'm looking forward to it until next year.I'm looking forward to it now."</sup></p>
<p id="L266"><br></p>
<p id="L267">"Oh, yes.

There's shaved ice among the things I brought. Do you want to try it when you get home?"</sup></p>
<p id="L268"><br></p>
<p id="L269">Among the frozen foods I brought from Japan, there must have been strawberry-flavored packaged shaved ice.<br><sup>日本から持ってきた冷凍食品の中には、イチゴ味のパックカキ氷があったはずだ。</sup><br><sup>Among the frozen foods brought from Japan, there must have been strawberry-flavored shaved ice.</sup></p>
<p id="L270">The texture is much different from the one made by a shaved ice machine, but it is definitely shaved ice.<br><sup>カキ氷機で作ったものとはだいぶ食感が異なるが、カキ氷には違いない。</sup><br><sup>The texture is very different from that of the shaved ice machine, but it must be shaved ice.</sup></p>
<p id="L271">As usual, Zirconia is working hard day after day, so I can give her a set of LipoD.<br><sup>相変わらずジルコニアは連日働きづめなので、リポＤとセットで与えてもいいだろう。</sup><br><sup>As always, zirconia works day after day, so you can give it as a set with lipo D.</sup></p>
<p id="L272"><br></p>

<p id="L274"><br></p>
<p id="L275">Zirconia's face lit up, as if she was very happy with the proposal.<br><sup>ジルコニアはよほど嬉しい提案だったのか、ぱっと表情を輝かせた。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia's expression suddenly brightened, perhaps because it was a very happy proposal.</sup></p>
