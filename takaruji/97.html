<p id="L3">Kazura had taken Zirconia to visit the upscale commercial section of Isteria.<br><sup>一良はジルコニアを連れて、イステリアの高級商業区画を訪れていた。</sup><br><sup>Ichira was taking Zirconia with him to a high-end commercial district in Isteria.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">The two of them were dressed differently than usual, in simple, plain, commoner clothes.<br><sup>２人の服装はいつもとは違い、簡素な無地の平民服だ。</sup><br><sup>Their clothes are plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain plain.</sup></p>
<p id="L5">He wore a cloak on his shoulders and held a zuta bag in his hand, looking like a traveler.<br><sup>肩にはマントを着けてズタ袋を手にしており、旅人のような格好である。</sup><br><sup>He wore a cloak on his shoulder and was dressed like a traveler with a bag of junk in his hand.</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">Zirconia's hair was tied in a knot at the back of her neck and she was disguised, if only for comfort.<br><sup>ジルコニアは髪を首の後ろで１つに結び、気休め程度にだが変装している。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia has hair tied in one piece at the back of the neck and is disguised as a relief.</sup></p>
<p id="L8">I usually go to military-related facilities, so my face is well known, but I rarely see civilians.<br><sup>普段、軍関連の施設にはよく出向くので顔が割れているが、一般市民と顔を合わせることは滅多にない。</sup><br><sup>He often goes to military-related facilities, so his face is broken, but he rarely meets ordinary citizens.</sup></p>
<p id="L9">Different clothes and hairstyles give a different impression, so even if you've seen Zirconia's face once or twice, there's no need to worry about her face being exposed.<br><sup>服装や髪型が違えば印象もがらりと変わるので、たとえ１度か２度ジルコニアの顔を見たことがある者だとしても、顔バレする心配はまずないだろう。</sup><br><sup>Different clothes and hairstyles can completely change your impression, so even if you've seen zirconia's face once or twice, you don't have to worry about finding out.</sup></p>
<p id="L10">It is a trick that is possible only in this world where mass media is not developed.<br><sup>マスメディアの発達していない、この世界だからこそ可能な芸当だ。</sup><br><sup>This is a possible performance in this world where the mass media is not developed.</sup></p>
<p id="L11"><br></p>
<p id="L12">"This is the general store. I bought a few things from them on a previous visit.<br><sup>「この雑貨屋です。以前訪れた時に、いくつか品物を買い取ってもらいましてね」</sup><br><sup>"This general store.When I visited you before, you bought me some items."</sup></p>
<p id="L13"><br></p>
<p id="L14">...... to be setting up store in such an imposing manner, and yet to be committing fraud in the eyes of the law."<br><sup>「……こんなに堂々と店を構えているのに、法の目をかいくぐって詐欺行為を行っているとは」</sup><br><sup>"...I can't believe you're cheating under the law even though you have such a proud store."</sup></p>
<p id="L15"><br></p>
<p id="L16">Last night, Kazuyoshi told Narson and Zirconia about the old lady at the grocery store who had beaten him to buy an ocarina and a red crystal.<br><sup>昨晩、一良はナルソンとジルコニアに、雑貨屋の老婦人にオカリナや紅水晶を買い叩かれたという話をした。</sup><br><sup>Last night, Ichira told Narson and Zirconia that an old lady at a general store had bought her ocarina and red quartz.</sup></p>
<p id="L17">I wanted to explain to him that I was someone who had a pipeline to sell even rare items without causing rumors, but after hearing his explanation, Narson said that he wanted to find out the character of the other party before proposing a deal.<br><sup>珍しい品物でも噂を立てずに売りさばくパイプを持っている人物ということを説明したかったのだが、その説明を聞いたナルソンは「取引を持ちかける前に相手の性格を探ってみたい」と言い出した。</sup><br><sup>I wanted to explain that he had a pipe to sell even rare items without making rumors, but when he heard the explanation, Naruson said, "I want to find out the other person's personality before I ask for a deal."</sup></p>
<p id="L18"><br></p>
<p id="L19">According to the plan that Kazuyoshi and Zirconia had originally made, they were going to offer the name of the Istair family first to negotiate with them.<br><sup>当初一良とジルコニアが立てた予定では、先にイステール家の名を出して交渉を持ちかける予定だった。</sup><br><sup>Originally, Ichira and Zirconia planned to propose negotiations under the name of the Istair family.</sup></p>
<p id="L20">But first, Narson said, he needed to determine how the old lady would respond if he offered her the same kind of negotiation as last time while hiding his identity.<br><sup>だがその前に、身分を隠した状態で前回と同様の交渉を持ちかけた場合、その老婦人がどういった対応をするかを見極める必要があるとナルソンは言っていた。</sup><br><sup>But before that, Narson said he needed to figure out what the old lady would do if she had asked for the same kind of negotiation as last time, while hiding her status.</sup></p>
<p id="L21">If the old lady responded in the same way as last time, it would mean that she only had that level of intelligence.<br><sup>もし老婦人が前回と同じような対応をしたら、彼女はその程度の頭しか持っていないということになる。</sup><br><sup>If the old lady responds the same way as last time, it means she has only that much brains.</sup></p>
<p id="L22">If you don't have the brains to disclose a certain amount of information before Kazuyoshi does, or to offer a good deal of information to Kazuyoshi, you won't be able to use it.<br><sup>一良が他で情報を仕入れている可能性を考えて、一良に先んじてある程度の情報を開示するかこちらにも旨みを提供するくらいの頭がなければ、とてもではないが使えたものではない。</sup><br><sup>Considering the possibility that Ichira might be buying information elsewhere, it would not have been possible to use it if he did not have the brains to disclose some information before Ichira did.</sup></p>
<p id="L23"><br></p>
<p id="L24">Incidentally, I also told Narson and the others that Kazuyoshi had visited Isteria before with Baretta and the others.<br><sup>ちなみに、一良が以前イステリアにバレッタたちと訪れたということもナルソンたちには話してある。</sup><br><sup>By the way, it has also been told to the Narusons that Ichira had visited the Isteria with the Valletta and others before.</sup></p>
<p id="L25">He asked me how I came to visit the grocery store, and I answered, but when I told him that I had also encountered Lise and the others in the process, Zirconia looked very surprised.<br><sup>雑貨屋に訪れた経緯を聞かれたので答えたのだが、その過程でリーゼたちとも遭遇したことがあるという話をすると、ジルコニアはとても驚いた様子だった。</sup><br><sup>Asked how he visited the general store, he answered, but Zirconia looked very surprised to hear that he had met Liese in the process.</sup></p>
<p id="L26">Narson remembered Eira's reaction when she had met with Ichiran before, and nodded in agreement, "So that's what happened.<br><sup>ナルソンは以前エイラが一良と顔を合わせたときの反応を思い出したのか、「そういうことだったのですか」と納得したように頷いていた。</sup><br><sup>Naruson nodded convincingly, "Is that what happened?" perhaps because he remembered Ayla's reaction when she met Ichira before.</sup></p>
<p id="L27"><br></p>
<p id="L28">No, we don't know yet if he's a habitual fraud.<br><sup>「いや、常習的に詐欺を行っているのかはまだ分かりませんよ」</sup><br><sup>"No, I don't know if he's always cheating."</sup></p>
<p id="L29"><br></p>
<p id="L30">There is no doubt that it is a store that is profiting from fraud. I'm not too keen on getting help from someone like this. ......"<br><sup>「それはそうですが、詐欺を行って利益を上げている店だということは疑いようがありません。こんな者の手を借りるのはあまり気が進まないのですが……」</sup><br><sup>"That's true, but there's no doubt that it's a fraudulent and profitable store.I don't feel very comfortable with the help of such a man."</sup></p>
<p id="L31"><br></p>
<p id="L32">"That's true, but we should use whatever we can at this point. We should be able to tolerate a few things."<br><sup>「それはそうですが、この際使える物は何でも使うべきですよ。多少のことには目を瞑るべきです」</sup><br><sup>"That's true, but you should use whatever you can in this case.You should close your eyes to a few things."</sup></p>
<p id="L33"><br></p>
<p id="L34">When Kazuyoshi said this to Zirconia, whose expression was clouded, Zirconia showed a momentary puzzled expression.<br><sup>表情を曇らせているジルコニアに一良がそう言うと、ジルコニアは一瞬きょとんとした表情を見せた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira said that to Zirconia, whose expression was clouded, Zirconia showed a blank look for a moment.</sup></p>
<p id="L35">But soon, she giggled happily.<br><sup>だがすぐに、楽しそうにくすりと笑みをこぼす。</sup><br><sup>Soon, however, he smiled merrily and happily.</sup></p>
<p id="L36"><br></p>
<p id="L37">"Hmm?　What's wrong?"<br><sup>「ん？　どうかしましたか？」</sup><br><sup>"Huh? What's the matter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L38"><br></p>
<p id="L39">"Hmm, it's nothing. You're right, Kazura, this is not the time to be worrying about details. But ......"<br><sup>「ふふ、何でもないです。カズラさんの言うとおり、細かいことに気をかけている場合ではありませんよね。でも……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, it's nothing.As Kazura said, it's not the time to be careful about details.But..."</sup></p>
<p id="L40"><br></p>
<p id="L41">Zirconia said, and put her hands on her back hip, hidden by her cloak.<br><sup>ジルコニアはそう言うと、マントに隠れた背中側の腰に手を当てた。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia said so, and put her hand on the back hip hidden in the cloak.</sup></p>
<p id="L42"><br></p>
<p id="L43">Be careful when you negotiate. I don't think so, but there is a possibility that the other party may try to be rough with you. It's not surprising that a store like this would have one or two bouncers.<br><sup>「交渉の際は、一応注意してください。ないとは思いますが、もしかしたら相手方が手荒な真似をしてくる可能性もあります。詐欺を行うような店ですから、用心棒の１人や２人置いていてもおかしくありません」</sup><br><sup>"Please be careful when negotiating.I don't think so, but there's a possibility that the other party will act rough.It's a fraudulent shop, so it's safe to have one or two guards."</sup></p>
<p id="L44"><br></p>
<p id="L45">Just in case, Zirconia has a dagger tucked under her cloak.<br><sup>念のため、ジルコニアはマントの下に短剣を忍ばせている。</sup><br><sup>Just in case, Zirconia has a dagger hidden under her cloak.</sup></p>
<p id="L46">It seems that if the negotiations don't go as planned, and if there is a disturbing trend and some kind of bouncer comes out, she is the one to deal with.<br><sup>交渉が思うように行かず、不穏な流れになって用心棒のようなものが出てきた場合は、彼女が相手をするらしい。</sup><br><sup>If the negotiations don't go the way she wants them to, and there's a kind of security guard coming out, she'll deal with them.</sup></p>
<p id="L47">Narson had told me that not many people could compete with her with weapons, but I wanted to avoid any disturbing developments if possible.<br><sup>武器を持った彼女に太刀打ちできる者はそうそういないとナルソンから聞いてはいるが、できることなら物騒な展開は避けたい。</sup><br><sup>I've heard from Naruson that there aren't many people who can compete with her with weapons, but I want to avoid dangerous developments if possible developments.</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">The reason why Zirconia is accompanying them and not Isaac or Havel is simply because she is much more skilled than they are.<br><sup>アイザックやハベルではなくジルコニアが同行しているのは、単純に彼女が彼らよりもはるかに腕が立つからだ。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia, not Isaac or Hubbard, accompanied her simply because she is much better than them.</sup></p>
<p id="L50">He has more experience in actual combat than most people, so he can deal with things on the fly.<br><sup>実戦の経験数が他の者とは比べ物にならないため、とっさのことにも対処できるらしい。</sup><br><sup>The number of hands-on combat experiences is incomparable to that of others, so they seem to be able to cope with emergencies.</sup></p>
<p id="L51">In addition to that, he thought that a female companion would be more comfortable than a male companion, which would make them less cautious.<br><sup>それに加え、同行者は男よりも女の方が、相手の警戒も和らぐだろうとの考えもある。</sup><br><sup>In addition, some people believe that the other person's vigilance will be eased by women rather than men's.</sup></p>
<p id="L52"><br></p>
<p id="L53">I understand. But even if that happens, let's think about running away rather than fighting back. It would be boring to get hurt in such a situation."<br><sup>「わかりました。ですが、もしそうなったとしても、応戦するより逃げることを考えましょう。こんなことで怪我をしてもつまらないんで」</sup><br><sup>"All right, but if that happens, let's think of fleeing rather than responding.It's no use getting hurt by this."</sup></p>
<p id="L54"><br></p>
<p id="L55">That's right. Well, if there's a commotion, the private army that's hiding and waiting is ready to move in, so I think we'll be fine. As long as we are not taken hostage."<br><sup>「そうですね。まあ、騒ぎになれば隠れて待機している私兵が突入する手はずになっているので、まず大丈夫だとは思います。我々が人質にでも取られない限りは」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I think it'll be all right first because private soldiers waiting in hiding are supposed to rush in if there's a disturbance.Unless we are taken hostage."</sup></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">With that, Zirconia smiled softly and walked into the store.<br><sup>そう言ってジルコニアは柔らかく微笑むと、店の中へと入っていった。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia smiled softly and went into the shop.</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59"><br></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">Hello. I'd like to buy something from you."<br><sup>「こんにちは。買い取ってもらいたいものがあるのですが」</sup><br><sup>"Hello. I'd like you to buy me something."</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63">Kazuyoshi walked into the store and went to the back, where he approached an old lady who was sitting and keeping a ledger, just as she had done when he had visited before.<br><sup>一良は店の中に入ると奥へ進み、以前訪れた時と同じように座って帳面をつけている老婦人に声をかけた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira entered the shop, he went deep and called out to the old lady, who was sitting down and keeping a notebook as she had done before.</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">"Yes, welcome to ...... Oh, I believe you're ......."<br><sup>「はい、いらっしゃい……おや、お前さんは確か……」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, come here... oh, I'm sure you are..."</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">The old woman looked up and raised her eyebrows in surprise when she saw Kazuyoshi's face.<br><sup>老婦人は顔を上げると、一良の顔を見て驚いたように眉を上げた。</sup><br><sup>The old woman looked up and raised her eyebrows in surprise at Ichira's face.</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">"Yes, I bought some jewelry from you the other day. I'm here because I want to buy a few more things from you. ......"<br><sup>「ええ、この間宝石を買い取ってもらった者です。またいくつか買い取ってもらいたいものがあって来たのですが……」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, the other day they bought me jewelry.I'd like you to buy me some more."</sup></p>
<p id="L70"><br></p>
<p id="L71">That's right. I'll buy as much as you want, just leave it to me. ...... By the way, where's your sister?"<br><sup>「そうかいそうかい。いくらでも買い取ってやるからね、任せておきな。……ところで、そちらの姉さんは？」</sup><br><sup>"A general assembly.I'll buy you as much as I want, so leave it to me. ... by the way, what about your sister?"</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">Zirconia, who had been looking around the store, smiled at the old lady who was giving her a curious look.<br><sup>店内にきょろきょろを視線を走らせていたジルコニアは、いぶかしげな視線を向けてくる老婦人に微笑んだ。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia, who was staring around the store, smiled at the old woman who was staring at her suspiciously.</sup></p>
<p id="L74"><br></p>
<p id="L75">That's my wife. I forced my husband to bring me with him."<br><sup>「この者の妻ですわ。夫に無理を言って、一緒に連れてきてもらいましたの」</sup><br><sup>"This is his wife,"I forced my husband to bring me here with me."</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">"Well, that's quite a beautiful wife you've got there. You're not as bad as you look, you know.<br><sup>「ほう、こりゃまたずいぶんと綺麗な嫁さんだ。お前さん、見かけによらずやるじゃないか」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, she's a very beautiful daughter-in-law again.You don't care what you look like."</sup></p>
<p id="L78"><br></p>
<p id="L79">Well, thank you very much, ......, and I'm talking about jewelry.<br><sup>「そ、そりゃどうも……で、宝石の話なんですが」</sup><br><sup>"Well, thank you very much... and I'm talking about jewels."</sup></p>
<p id="L80"><br></p>
<p id="L81">Wait a minute.<br><sup>「ちょっと待ちな」</sup><br><sup>"Wait a minute,"</sup></p>
<p id="L82"><br></p>
<p id="L83">The old woman then took a sign that said "Preparing" from the corner of the store and placed it at the entrance of the store.<br><sup>老婦人はそう言うと、店内の隅に置かれていた『準備中』と書かれた看板を取り、店の入り口に設置した。</sup><br><sup>When the old lady said so, she took a sign in the corner and placed it at the entrance of the shop saying, and placed it at the entrance of the shop.</sup></p>
<p id="L84"><br></p>
<p id="L85">"There we go. Let's go talk in the back room, just in case."<br><sup>「これでよし。念のため、奥の部屋で話すとしようか」</sup><br><sup>"That's all right. Let's talk in the back room just in case."</sup></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">As the old woman walked into the back of the building, Zirconia stopped Irira from following her.<br><sup>老婦人が建物の奥へと入っていくと、後に続こうとする一良をジルコニアが引き止めた。</sup><br><sup>As the old woman entered the back of the building, Zirconia stopped Ichira from following her.</sup></p>
<p id="L88"><br></p>
<p id="L89">"...... I'll go first. Don't ever leave."<br><sup>「……私が先に行きます。絶対に離れないでください」</sup><br><sup>"...I'll go first.Don't ever leave me."</sup></p>
<p id="L90"><br></p>
<p id="L91">After hearing this, Zirconia followed the old lady into the back of the room.<br><sup>そう耳打ちすると、ジルコニアは奥へと入っていく老婦人の後に付いていく。</sup><br><sup>Whispering, Zirconia follows an old woman who goes deep.</sup></p>
<p id="L92">Kazuyoshi followed Zirconia and went through the door.<br><sup>一良もジルコニアに続き、戸をくぐった。</sup><br><sup>Ichira followed Zirconia through the door.</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94">Guys, I think we're done for the day.<br><sup>「お前たち、今日はもう仕事はおしまいでいいよ」</sup><br><sup>"You're done with your work for the day,"</sup></p>
<p id="L95"><br></p>
<p id="L96">In the back room, there were six girls.<br><sup>奥の部屋には、女の子が６人いた。</sup><br><sup>There were six girls in the back room.</sup></p>
<p id="L97">Their ages varied from about six years old to mid-teens.<br><sup>年は６歳くらいから10代半ばくらいまでと、バラバラだ。</sup><br><sup>The ages range from about six to mid-teen.</sup></p>
<p id="L98">The girls sit on the floor with needles and knives in their hands, working on leather goods such as shoes and gloves.<br><sup>女の子たちは針やナイフを手に、床に座り込んで靴や手袋といった革製品の製造に当たっている。</sup><br><sup>The girls sit on the floor with needles and knives in their hands to make leather products such as shoes and gloves.</sup></p>
<p id="L99">The room was furnished with a long table and a fireplace.<br><sup>部屋の中には長テーブルが置かれており、暖炉も設置されていた。</sup><br><sup>There was a long table and a fireplace in the room.</sup></p>
<p id="L100"><br></p>
<p id="L101">"Yeah, but ......"<br><sup>「え、でも……」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, but..."</sup></p>
<p id="L102"><br></p>
<p id="L103">One of the girls shouted in confusion at the old lady's words.<br><sup>老婦人の言葉に、女の子の１人が戸惑ったように声を上げた。</sup><br><sup>One of the girls exclaimed bewilderedly at the old lady's words.</sup></p>
<p id="L104">The other girls also gave the old lady an uneasy look.<br><sup>他の女の子たちも、不安そうな眼差しを老婦人に向ける。</sup><br><sup>The other girls also looked at the old lady anxiously.</sup></p>
<p id="L105"><br></p>
<p id="L106">"Hmm?　...... Oh, don't worry, I'll give you your wages for today."<br><sup>「ん？　……ああ、心配しなくても今日の分の賃金は出してやるよ」</sup><br><sup>"Huh? ...oh, I'll pay you today's wages without worrying."</sup></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">The old woman took out a cloth bag from her pocket and handed it to a girl who was close at hand.<br><sup>老婦人は懐から布袋を取り出すと、それを手近にいた女の子に手渡した。</sup><br><sup>The old lady took a cloth bag out of her pocket and handed it to the girl near her.</sup></p>
<p id="L109">The girl quickly opens the bag and checks the money inside.<br><sup>女の子はすぐに袋を開き、中のお金を確認している。</sup><br><sup>The girl immediately opened the bag and was checking the money inside.</sup></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111">It's still early afternoon, so why don't you go to the river to pick up the boulders I taught you the other day? You can take the basket there."<br><sup>「まだ昼過ぎだし、この間教えた丸石を拾いに川にでも行ってみたらどうだい。そこにあるカゴを持っていっていいよ」</sup><br><sup>"It's still after noon, so why don't you go to the river to pick up the stones I told you the other day?You may take the basket over there."</sup></p>
<p id="L112"><br></p>
<p id="L113">"Yes, thank you. Guys, let's go, shall we?"<br><sup>「はい、ありがとうございます。みんな、行こう？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, thank you very much.Shall we all go?"</sup></p>
<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115">The girls bowed to the old woman and left with the baskets they had left in the room.<br><sup>女の子たちは老婦人に頭を下げると、部屋に置いてあったカゴを持って出て行った。</sup><br><sup>The girls bowed to the old lady and went out with the basket left in the room.</sup></p>
<p id="L116"><br></p>
<p id="L117">"Take a seat in that chair. I'll serve you some tea."<br><sup>「そこの椅子に適当に腰かけておくれ。どれ、茶でも出そうかね」</sup><br><sup>"Sit down in that chair, please.Let's have some tea, shall we?"</sup></p>
<p id="L118"><br></p>
<p id="L119">The old lady waited for the girls to leave and offered chairs to Kazura and Zirconia.<br><sup>老婦人は女の子たちが出て行くのを待ち、一良とジルコニアに椅子を勧める。</sup><br><sup>The old lady waited for the girls to leave and recommended a chair to Ichira and Zirconia.</sup></p>
<p id="L120"><br></p>
<p id="L121">No, I have an urgent appointment later, so I'd like to start the transaction right away at ......."<br><sup>「いえ、この後に急ぎの予定が入っていますので……すぐに取引を始めさせていただきたいのですが」</sup><br><sup>"No, I have an urgent schedule after this... I'd like to start doing business with you right away."</sup></p>
<p id="L122"><br></p>
<p id="L123">"Oh, I see. Well then, I guess I'll do it.<br><sup>「ん、そうかい。それなら、そうするとしようか」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, sir.If so, shall we?"</sup></p>
<p id="L124"><br></p>
<p id="L125">When Zirconia quickly refused the tea, the old lady sat down in her chair without seeming to be particularly bothered.<br><sup>とっさにジルコニアがお茶を断ると、老婦人は特に気にした様子もなくそのまま椅子に座った。</sup><br><sup>Suddenly Zirconia declined the cup of tea, and the old woman sat down in her chair without a trace of concern.</sup></p>
<p id="L126">Following the old lady, Kazuyoshi and Zirconia sat down on chairs.<br><sup>老婦人に続き、一良とジルコニアも椅子に腰かける。</sup><br><sup>Following the old lady, Ichira and Zirconia also sit down.</sup></p>
<p id="L127"><br></p>
<p id="L128">Well, what have you got for me today?"<br><sup>「さて、今日はどんなものを持ってきてくれたんだい？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, what did you bring for me to-day?"</sup></p>
<p id="L129"><br></p>
<p id="L130">I've prepared a few pieces of jewelry similar to the ones I sold you last time." ......

<p id="L161">Of course I want to make more money. Even if I can fool you again, if you find out later and go elsewhere, it will be the last time.

<p id="L294">"I've heard stories from girls with experience from time to time, but I only know enough to get by on small talk.
