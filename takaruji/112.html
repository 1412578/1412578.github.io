<p id="L1">The next day, some distance away from Liese, who was answering the questions of the craftsmen, Kazuyoshi was absentmindedly recalling his conversation with Zirconia.<br><sup>翌日、職人たちの質問に答えているリーゼから少し離れた所で、一良はぼーっとジルコニアとの会話を思い返していた。</sup><br><sup>The next day, some distance from Liese, who was answering the craftsmen's questions, Ichira was absent-mindedly recalling his conversation with Zirconia.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">He had thought that there would be no way to avoid war, but yesterday Zirconia had spoken as if the war would surely start.<br><sup>戦争回避の道もないわけではないだろうと考えていたが、昨日のジルコニアは確実に開戦するような口ぶりだった。</sup><br><sup>I thought there would be a way to avoid war, but yesterday's zirconia sounded like it was going to start a war.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">I wondered why Balbert was so adamant about attacking the allies, but perhaps that was exactly what I should have been thinking about.<br><sup>どうしてそこまでバルベールは同盟国攻略に固執するのだろうとも考えたが、それこそ考えても仕方のないことなのかもしれない。</sup><br><sup>I also wondered why Valver was so stubborn about attacking his allies, but it may be no use thinking about it.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">When I think back to the history of war on Earth, there are so many unreasonable reasons.<br><sup>地球での戦争の歴史を思い返してみても、理不尽な理由など腐るほどある。</sup><br><sup>Looking back at the history of war on Earth, there are so many unreasonable reasons.</sup></p>
<p id="L5"><br></p>
<p id="L6">"(...... If we start a war like this, this country will surely be destroyed, right?<br><sup>「（……このまま開戦したら、この国は確実に滅ぶよな）」</sup><br><sup>"(...if the war continues, this country will surely perish)."</sup></p>

<p id="L8">From the war documents he had seen the other day, Kazuyoshi had a vague idea of the strength of Istair's territory.<br><sup>先日見た戦時資料で、一良はイステール領の戦力をおぼろげながら把握していた。</sup><br><sup>In the wartime data I saw the other day, Ichira vaguely grasped the combat capabilities of the Istair domain's combat capabilities.</sup></p>
<p id="L9">It seems that the last time they were able to fight more than evenly because the enemy kept making bad moves at the beginning of the war.<br><sup>前回は敵が開戦当初にまずい手を打ち続けたために、互角以上の戦いをすることができたようだ。</sup><br><sup>Last time, the enemy continued to take bad measures at the beginning of the war, so it seems that they were able to fight more than even.</sup></p>
<p id="L10">But the enemy will not play the same trick next time.<br><sup>だが、敵も次は同じ手は食わないだろう。</sup><br><sup>But the enemy won't take the same approach next time.</sup></p>
<p id="L11">They would have to take some kind of countermeasures, and if they betrayed the neighboring Krayrats, there was no way they could win.<br><sup>何らかの対策は講じてくるだろうし、隣のクレイラッツまで裏切るとなったら、勝てる見込みなど皆無である。</sup><br><sup>He will take some measures, and if he betrays his neighbor, Clairats, he has no chance of winning.</sup></p>

<p id="L15">Ichiryo is well aware that the introduction of ironware will drastically change the power structure of the world.<br><sup>鉄器の導入によって世界の勢力図が大きく変わることは、一良もよく分かっている。</sup><br><sup>Ichira is well aware that the introduction of ironware will greatly change the world's power map.</sup></p>
<p id="L16">Iron, a powerful and inexpensive metal, is much more powerful than bronze.<br><sup>鉄というパワフルで安価な金属は、青銅よりもはるかに強力だ。</sup><br><sup>Iron, a powerful and inexpensive metal, is much more powerful than bronze.</sup></p>
<p id="L17">Not only the military, but all industries in the country will benefit, which will dramatically increase the country's strength.<br><sup>軍事だけでなく、その国のすべての産業が恩恵を受けるので、飛躍的に国力が増強される。</sup><br><sup>Not only the military, but also all industries in the country benefit, so national strength is greatly enhanced.</sup></p>
<p id="L18">Moreover, processing and refining techniques do not require trial and error once they are passed on by Ichiryo.<br><sup>しかも、加工技術や精製技術は、一良が伝えれば試行錯誤の必要もない。</sup><br><sup>Furthermore, there is no need for trial and error in processing and refining technology, as Ichira put it.</sup></p>
<p id="L19">Arcadia, which has a large vein of iron in its territory, will start on the path to becoming a superpower.<br><sup>領内に鉄の大鉱脈を持つアルカディアは、一躍超大国への道を歩み始めるだろう。</sup><br><sup>Arcadia, which has a large iron vein in its territory, will suddenly start on the road to becoming a superpower.</sup></p>

<p id="L21">"(It would be unfashionable if the country was destroyed if we didn't do anything about it. ......

<p id="L22"><br></p>
<p id="L23">As Kazuyoshi pondered on his own, he saw Isaac running up to him out of the corner of his eye.<br><sup>一良が１人で考え込んでいると、視界の隅にアイザックが駆け寄ってくるのが見えた。</sup><br><sup>While Ichira was thinking alone, he saw Isaac running to the corner of his vision.</sup></p>
<p id="L24">When Isaac reached under Ichiran, he straightened his posture and bowed.<br><sup>アイザックは一良の下にたどり着くと、姿勢を正して礼をする。</sup><br><sup>When Isaac gets under Ichira, he straightens his posture and salutes.</sup></p>
<p id="L25"><br></p>
<p id="L26">"Mr. Kazura, I have the over-the-counter drug information for you.<br><sup>「カズラ様、市販薬の資料をお持ちいたしました」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Kazura, I have some information on over-the-counter drugs."</sup></p>

<p id="L29"><br></p>
<p id="L30">I received a piece of leather paper bound with a leather strap and flipped through it.<br><sup>革紐で束ねられた皮紙を受け取り、めくってみる。</sup><br><sup>Take the leather paper tied up with a strap and flip it.</sup></p>
<p id="L31">The contents were a list of types of medicines, their effects, and the herbs they were based on.<br><sup>内容は、薬の種類と効能、元になる薬草の一覧表だった。</sup><br><sup>The contents are a list of the types and efficacy of medicines and the underlying herbs.</sup></p>
<p id="L32"><br></p>
<p id="L33">"Well, what does it say in the section on Wound Pills and Laxatives ......?<br><sup>「ええと、傷薬と便秘薬……あの、便秘薬のところに書いてあるこれ、何て読むんです？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, wound medicine and constipation medicine... well, how do you read this written in the constipation medicine?"</sup></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35">"That's 'seawater,' isn't it?<br><sup>「それは『海水』ですね」</sup><br><sup>"That's 'sea water,' isn't it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L36"><br></p>
<p id="L37">"Oh, seawater? Are you going to drink it straight?"<br><sup>「え、海水ですか。もしかして、そのまま飲むんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, seawater?Do you happen to drink it as it is?"</sup></p>
<p id="L38"><br></p>
<p id="L39">Isaac nodded to Ichira, who looked surprised.<br><sup>驚いた顔をしている一良に、アイザックが頷く。</sup><br><sup>Isaac nods to Ichira, who looks surprised.</sup></p>
<p id="L40"><br></p>
<p id="L41">"Yes. If you drink a bowlful of seawater, you will immediately get diarrhea. Peddlers from areas where there is a sea bring it here.<br><sup>「はい。海水をお椀一杯分くらい飲むと、すぐにおなかがぐるぐるいって下痢が出ます。海のある地域からきた行商人が運んできますね」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, if you drink about a bowl of seawater, you'll have diarrhea as soon as you have a stomachache.A peddler from a certain area of the sea will bring it."</sup></p>
<p id="L42"><br></p>
<p id="L43">"No, that's a very violent way to go. It looks bad for you."<br><sup>「ず、ずいぶんと乱暴な方法ですね。身体に悪そうだ」</sup><br><sup>"Well, it's a very violent way.It looks bad for you."</sup></p>
<p id="L44"><br></p>
<p id="L45">"Yes, it does seem to make you a little sick. But it's much cheaper than herbal laxatives, so many people take it.<br><sup>「確かに、少し体調を崩すようですね。ですが、薬草を使った便秘薬よりはるかに安価なので、飲む人は多いですよ」</sup><br><sup>"It's true that you're a little sick, but many people take it because it's much cheaper than herbal laxatives."</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">The document listed a number of drugs.<br><sup>資料には、多数の薬が記載されていた。</sup><br><sup>The data contained a number of drugs.</sup></p>
<p id="L48">It seems that there are many medicines that are different from those that use medicinal herbs, such as "charcoal" in the section on anti-diarrhea and "milk of myagi" in the section on stomach medicine.<br><sup>下痢止めの項目に『木炭』と書いてあったり、胃薬に『ミャギの乳』と書いてあったりと、薬草を用いるものとは違った薬もたくさんあるようだ。</sup><br><sup>There are many medicines that are different from those that use herbs, such as charcoal in the anti-diarrhea section and milk in the stomach.</sup></p>
<p id="L49"><br></p>
<p id="L50">"Lady Kazura, what are my plans for the future?"<br><sup>「カズラ様、今後の私の予定なのですが」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Kazura, what are my plans for the future?"</sup></p>
<p id="L51"><br></p>
<p id="L52">While Kazuyoshi was looking at the documents with admiration, Isaac called out to him in a reserved manner.<br><sup>一良が感心しながら資料を見ていると、アイザックが遠慮がちに声をかけてきた。</sup><br><sup>As Ichira looked at the materials admiringly, Isaac spoke to him with restraint.</sup></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54">"May I stay with the garrison guarding the village of Grisea for a little while? I would like to negotiate with the village."<br><sup>「少しの間、グリセア村を警護する守備隊のところに滞在してもよろしいでしょうか。村との折衝を行おうと思うのですが」</sup><br><sup>"May I stay with the guards who guard the village of Glyceria for a while?I'd like to negotiate with the village."</sup></p>
<p id="L55"><br></p>
<p id="L56">"Oh, yes. I think I'd better have him do that. But in the meantime, no Isaac-san or ......."<br><sup>「あ、そうですね。そうしてもらったほうがいいかな。でも、その間はアイザックさん無しか……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that'sir.Maybe you should do that.But in the meantime, Mr. Isaac is missing..."</sup></p>
<p id="L57"><br></p>
<p id="L58">It will be very hard to lose Isaac, who does a lot of work on his own, but it is also important to negotiate between the village and the garrison.<br><sup>色々と自ら動き回ってくれるアイザックがいなくなるとかなりきついが、村と守備隊の折衝も重要だ。</sup><br><sup>It is difficult to find Isaac, who can move around in various ways, but negotiations between the village and the garrison are also important.</sup></p>
<p id="L59">The hole left by him would have to be managed by myself and Havel.<br><sup>彼の抜けた穴は、自分とハベルでなんとかするしかないだろう。</sup><br><sup>He'll have to do something about the hole he's gone through with himself and Hubbard.</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">"I understand. I'll take care of this, so please organize the garrison well. Have you decided who the commander will be?"<br><sup>「分かりました。こちらはなんとかしますので、しっかり守備隊を取りまとめてください。指揮官は誰にするか決めましたか？」</sup><br><sup>"All right.We'll do something about it, so please keep the garrison together.Have you decided who to take command of?"</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63">"Yes. I have a cousin named Silvestria, and I'm going to leave her in charge. She's in the cavalry, but I've decided to pull her out of the unit."<br><sup>「はい。従姉妹にシルベストリアという者がいるのですが、彼女に任せようと思います。騎兵隊に所属していますが、部隊から引き抜くことにしました」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I have a cousin named Silvestria, and I'm going to leave it to her.I'm a member of the cavalry, but I've decided to pull them out of the unit."</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">"The cavalry, sir. Didn't she look disgusted?"<br><sup>「騎兵隊ですか。彼女は嫌な顔しませんでしたか？」</sup><br><sup>"The cavalry?"Didn't she look displeased?"</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">"It's okay. He is only 24 years old, but he is a very loyal and excellent soldier. He's a little hard-headed, but he's reliable."<br><sup>「それは大丈夫です。年は24と若いですが、非常に忠誠心の高い優秀な兵士です。少し頭の固いところがありますが、信頼できます」</sup><br><sup>"That's all right.He's 24 years old, but he's a very loyal and excellent soldier.I'm a little stubborn, but I can trust you."</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">"Oh, that's very encouraging ......, but does being hard-headed mean you're not very flexible?"<br><sup>「ほうほう、それは頼もしい……でも、頭が固いっていうのは、あまり融通が利かないってことですかね？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's reliable... but if you're hard-headed, do you mean you're not very flexible?"</sup></p>
<p id="L70"><br></p>
<p id="L71">"No, he is a man with a very strong sense of justice and integrity. He is extremely averse to bribes and other forms of injustice, which is why he is suited for this mission. I will have him instruct all those who come in contact with Grisea Village to head to Isteria at once."<br><sup>「いえ、非常に正義感が強く、清廉潔白な人物なのです。賄賂などの不正を極度に嫌うため、今回の任務には向いています。グリセア村に接触してきた者は、すべて一度イステリアに向かうように指示させることにしておりますので」</sup><br><sup>"No, he has a strong sense of justice and is clean.He is well suited for the mission because he hates corruption such as bribery.for all who have come into contact with the village of Glyceria shall be instructed to head for the Easter once."</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">If Isaac, a hard man, can say that much, then he must be even more hard than Isaac.<br><sup>堅物なアイザックがそこまで言うということは、アイザック以上の相当な堅物なのだろう。</sup><br><sup>If Isaac, a hard man, says so, he is much more solid than Isaac.</sup></p>
<p id="L74">Isaac himself seems to be hard-headed or too serious, but he may be more than that.<br><sup>アイザック自身も頭が固いというか真面目すぎるように思えるが、それを上回る人物なのかもしれない。</sup><br><sup>Isaac himself seems to be stubborn or too serious, but he may be more than that.</sup></p>
<p id="L75">It would also help us deal with those who try to contact the Gricean village under our sleeves.<br><sup>袖の下でグリセア村に接触しようとする輩にも対処できそうだ。</sup><br><sup>I think I can deal with people who want to contact the village of Glyceria under my arm.</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">"I'm usually a very friendly and cheerful person. He also likes children, so I'm sure he'll get along well with everyone in the village. Please don't worry."<br><sup>「あ、といいましても、普段はとても気さくで朗らかな人です。子ども好きでもあるので、村のみなさんとも上手くやっていけると思います。ご安心ください」</sup><br><sup>"I say ah, but he's usually very friendly and cheerful.I also like children, so I think I can get along well with everyone in the village.Don't worry."</sup></p>
<p id="L78"><br></p>
<p id="L79">When Kazura imagined how stiff he was, Isaac noticed it and hurriedly excused himself.<br><sup>どれだけ堅物なんだろうかと一良が想像していると、それに気付いたアイザックが慌てて弁解した。</sup><br><sup>As Ichira imagined how solid he was, Isaac hurriedly excused himself.</sup></p>
<p id="L80">They seemed to have followed my instructions to choose based on personality.<br><sup>人柄優先で選ぶように、との指示は守ってくれたようだ。</sup><br><sup>He seems to have followed the instruction to prioritize his personality.</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">"When you say 'usually', do you mean when you get angry?"<br><sup>「『普段は』ってことは、怒るとすごかったりするんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Do you mean 'usually' when you get angry?"</sup></p>
<p id="L83"><br></p>
<p id="L84">"I heard that he once bribed his superiors to exempt him from cleaning latrines and half killed his colleagues. After that, he was sent to a punishment cell because he said, 'I understand how you feel, but you've gone too far.<br><sup>「そうですね……８年前、練兵隊所属時代に、上官に賄賂を渡して便所掃除を免除してもらっていた同僚を、上官もろとも半殺しにしたことがあると聞いたことがあります。その後、『気持ちは分かるがやりすぎだ』ということで懲罰房行きになったそうですが」</sup><br><sup>"Well...Eight years ago, when I was a member of the training corps, I heard that my colleagues, who had been exempted from cleaning the toilet by bribing their superiors, were killed half of them.After that, I was sent to a punishment cell because he said, 'I understand how you feel, but you've gone too far.'"</sup></p>
<p id="L85"><br></p>
<p id="L86">"This is too scary. ......<br><sup>「こ、怖すぎる……」</sup><br><sup>"This is too scary..."</sup></p>
<p id="L87"><br></p>
<p id="L88">From what I've heard, he seems to be more like a rabid dog than a mild-mannered one, but as long as you don't make him angry, he's fine.<br><sup>話を聞く限り、温和というよりも狂犬のような性格に思えるが、怒らせなければ問題ないらしい。</sup><br><sup>As far as I'm concerned, he seems to be more of a mad dog than a gentle one, but if he doesn't offend me, there's no problem.</sup></p>
<p id="L89">The fact that he was able to half-kill his superiors and colleagues as a cadet was terrifying, but so was his guts to attack his superiors.<br><sup>士官候補生でありながら上官と同僚をまとめて半殺しにできたという腕っ節も恐ろしいが、上官に襲い掛かるという根性もすさまじい。</sup><br><sup>Although he was a candidate for the military, he was able to kill his superiors and colleagues half-killed, but he also had a strong will to attack his superiors.</sup></p>
<p id="L90"><br></p>
<p id="L91">"Well, there are rumors that her superiors at the time also demanded a pillow in exchange for favors, and her colleagues also made foolish remarks about her, so I guess she got what she deserved. Even though she belonged to the Suran family, they must have underestimated her as a sixteen-year-old girl."<br><sup>「まあ、その時の上官も彼女に対して便宜と引き換えに枕を要求したり、同僚も彼女を馬鹿にした発言をしたという噂がありますから、自業自得なんじゃないですかね。スラン家の者とはいえ、16歳の小娘だと甘く見たのでしょう」</sup><br><sup>"Well, there are rumors that her boss asked her for a pillow for convenience, and that her colleagues made a fool of her, so it's her fault.Even though he was a member of the Suran family, he underestimated her as a sixteen-year-old little girl."</sup></p>
<p id="L92"><br></p>
<p id="L93">"Oh, really?"<br><sup>「そ、そうですか」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, is that so?"</sup></p>
<p id="L94"><br></p>
<p id="L95">As they were talking about this, Lise, who had finished explaining to the craftsmen, walked over to them.<br><sup>そんな話をしていると、職人への説明を終えたリーゼが２人の下へ歩いてきた。</sup><br><sup>As we talked, Liese, who had finished explaining to the craftsman, walked under them.</sup></p>
<p id="L96"><br></p>
<p id="L97">"Good work. Everything okay?"<br><sup>「お疲れさん。問題なさそうか？」</sup><br><sup>"Good job. Is there no problem?"</sup></p>
<p id="L98"><br></p>
<p id="L99">"Yeah, I'm probably fine. I'll call you if I need you, and Kazura can go work on something else."<br><sup>「うん、たぶん大丈夫。何かあったら呼びに行くから、カズラは別の作業に行っていいよ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, it's probably okay.I'll call you if something happens, so you can go to another job for Kazura."</sup></p>
<p id="L100"><br></p>
<p id="L101">Liese smiled and turned to Isaac.<br><sup>リーゼは笑顔を見せると、アイザックに向き直った。</sup><br><sup>Liese smiled and turned to Isaac.</sup></p>
<p id="L102"><br></p>
<p id="L103">"Master Isaac, are you the overseer of the well diggers?"<br><sup>「アイザック様は、井戸掘りの監督ですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Isaac the director of the well?"</sup></p>
<p id="L104"><br></p>
<p id="L105">"No, I'm heading to Grisea Village now.

<p id="L107">Isaac replied, and Lise smiled at him.<br><sup>アイザックが答えると、リーゼはにっこりと微笑んだ。</sup><br><sup>When Isaac answered, Liese smiled.</sup></p>
<p id="L108"><br></p>
<p id="L109">"I have a lot of people I can rely on, so I'll be fine.

<p id="L112"><br></p>
<p id="L113">Isaac bowed deeply to them both and walked away.<br><sup>アイザックは２人に深く一礼すると、歩き去っていった。</sup><br><sup>Isaac bowed deeply to them and walked away.</sup></p>
<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115">"But Isaac is such a hard worker. I wonder if all the people in the Suran family are like that."<br><sup>「それにしても、アイザックさんって働き者だよな。スラン家の人間ってみんなあんな感じなのかな」</sup><br><sup>"And yet, Mr. Isaac is a hard worker.I wonder if everyone in the Suran family is like that."</sup></p>
<p id="L116"><br></p>
<p id="L117">Kazura said as he looked off Isaac's back, and Lise nodded deeply.<br><sup>アイザックの背を見送りながら一良が言うと、リーゼは深く頷いた。</sup><br><sup>Seeing Isaac off his back, Ichira said, and Liese nodded deeply.</sup></p>
<p id="L118"><br></p>
<p id="L119">"Most of the people in that house are very serious. There are a few with quirky personalities, like McGregor."<br><sup>「あの家の人たちは生真面目な人が多いよ。マクレガーみたいに癖のある性格の人も少しいるけどね」</sup><br><sup>"Many of the people in that family are serious.There are a few people who have a habit like McGregor."</sup></p>
<p id="L120"><br></p>
<p id="L121">Isaac, Root, and the rest of the Suran family seem to be very serious people.<br><sup>アイザックといいルートといい、スラン家の者たちはやはり真面目な者が多いようだ。</sup><br><sup>It is said that Isaac is a good route, and many of the Surans seem to be serious.</sup></p>
<p id="L122">Kazuyoshi wondered what kind of person Silvestria, who had just been mentioned, was.<br><sup>さきほど話が出たシルベストリアは、いったいどんな人なのだろうかと一良は思いをはせるのだった。</sup><br><sup>Ichira wondered what Silvestria, who had just been mentioned, was like.</sup></p>

<p id="L126">Then a few hours later.<br><sup>それから数時間後。</sup><br><sup>A few hours later.</sup></p>
<p id="L127">As a river construction supervisor, Marie watched over the work of the laborers with a construction plan on her chest.<br><sup>河川工事の監督官として、マリーは工事計画書を胸に抱えて労働者たちの作業を見守っていた。</sup><br><sup>As a river engineering supervisor, Mary watched the workers work with a project plan in her arms.</sup></p>
<p id="L128">Since there is no single place where the construction work is done, Marie and her team are dispersed to supervise the work.<br><sup>工事を行う箇所は一箇所ではないため、マリーたちはそれぞれ分散して現場監督を行っている。</sup><br><sup>Mary and her colleagues are conducting site supervision separately because there is not one place to carry out the construction.</sup></p>
<p id="L129">The plan is not something that can be shown to anyone, so it is only shown to the head craftsman at the site.<br><sup>計画書は誰にでも見せていい代物ではないため、現場の職人頭にのみ見せている状態だ。</sup><br><sup>Since the plan is not a good thing to show to anyone, it is only for the head of the field.</sup></p>
<p id="L130">As expected, it was too much of a burden to be left to Marie alone, so Marie was set up with Eira.<br><sup>さすがにマリー１人に任せるのは荷が重過ぎるので、マリーはエイラとセットである。</sup><br><sup>Mary is a set with Ayla because it's too heavy to leave to Mary alone.</sup></p>
<p id="L131">Eira is not here at the moment, but has gone to pick up the workers' meals at a nearby cafeteria.<br><sup>今エイラはこの場にはおらず、労働者の食事を近場の食堂に取りに行っている。</sup><br><sup>Ayla is not here at the moment, but is going to a nearby restaurant to get food for the workers.</sup></p>

<p id="L137">Marie turned at the voice from behind her and choked on her words.<br><sup>マリーは背後からの声に振り返り、言葉を詰まらせた。</sup><br><sup>Mary looked back at the voice from behind and choked her words.</sup></p>
<p id="L138"><br></p>
<p id="L139">"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You've become a big shot."<br><sup>「おいおい、まさかお前が作業監督なんてしてるのか。偉くなったもんだなあ」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my God, you're the workmaster.You've grown great."</sup></p>

<p id="L141">There was Arondo on a wagon full of materials.<br><sup>そこには、資材を満載した荷馬車に乗ったアロンドの姿があった。</sup><br><sup>There was Alondo in a wagon full of materials.</sup></p>
<p id="L142">Arondo had the guard stop the wagon and jumped down from the guard stand.<br><sup>アロンドは御者に荷馬車を止めさせると、ひらりと御者台から飛び降りた。</sup><br><sup>Arond pulled up the wagon and jumped out of the cab.</sup></p>

<p id="L148"><br></p>
<p id="L149">Marie was shaking and unable to answer, and Arondo frowned slightly.<br><sup>カタカタと身体を震わせて答えられずにいるマリーに、アロンドは少し顔をしかめた。</sup><br><sup>Alondo frowned a little at Marie, who was trembling and unable to answer.</sup></p>
<p id="L150"><br></p>
<p id="L151">"Answer quickly. I'm asking you, "What do you think? I'm asking you.<br><sup>「さっさと答えろ。俺が『どうだ？』って聞いてるんだぞ」</sup><br><sup>"Answer quickly.I'm asking, 'What do you think?'"</sup></p>

<p id="L153">"I'm having a great time!　I'm really enjoying working with you guys, you care about me so much!<br><sup>「っ！　み、皆さんすごく気にかけてくださって、とても楽しくお仕事できています！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh! Everyone cares so much about me that I'm having a lot of fun working!"</sup></p>
<p id="L154"><br></p>
<p id="L155">Forgetting to even think about it, Marie replied with gusto.<br><sup>考えることさえ忘れ、勢い込んでマリーは答えた。</sup><br><sup>Marie replied enthusiastically, forgetting to think.</sup></p>
<p id="L156">Looking at her stiff and nervous, Arondo snickered.<br><sup>ガチガチに緊張している彼女を見つめ、アロンドは鼻で笑ってみせる。</sup><br><sup>Looking at her nervously nervous, Alondo smiles with his nose.</sup></p>
<p id="L157"><br></p>
<p id="L158">"'Fun', huh? You've got it all wrong, haven't you?"<br><sup>「『楽しく』、か。お前、何か勘違いしてるんじゃねえか？」</sup><br><sup>"'Fun,' said he.Are you mistaken about something?"</sup></p>
<p id="L159"><br></p>
<p id="L160">"...... huh?"<br><sup>「……え？」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L161"><br></p>
<p id="L162">Marie looks up anxiously at Arondo, who says in a tone of deep dismay.<br><sup>心底呆れたような口調で言うアロンドを、マリーは不安げに見上げる。</sup><br><sup>Marie looks up anxiously at Alondo, who says in a tone of utter amazement.</sup></p>
<p id="L163"><br></p>
<p id="L164">"You forgot that you are a slave. You forgot that you are a slave. You've got to be kidding me."<br><sup>「お前、自分が奴隷だってことを忘れてるだろ。なにが『楽しくお仕事できています』、だ。ふざけたこと言ってるんじゃねえぞ」</sup><br><sup>"You have forgotten that you are a slave.What's so exciting about your work?You're not kidding me."</sup></p>

<p id="L168">"You're not from the Luson family, and you're not a citizen. You're a slave.

<p id="L169"><br></p>
<p id="L170">"Yes."<br><sup>「はい」</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L171"><br></p>
<p id="L172">Marie replied as she stared into Arondo's eyes, just as she had when she worked at the Luzon residence.<br><sup>ルーソン邸で働いていた時のように、マリーはアロンドの目を見つめたまま答える。</sup><br><sup>Marie replies, staring into Alond's eyes, as she did when she worked at the Luzon residence.</sup></p>
<p id="L173">The reason I don't look away is because if I do, Alondo will hit me.<br><sup>目を逸らさない理由は、逸らすとアロンドに殴られるからだ。</sup><br><sup>The reason why I don't look away is that if I look away, Alonde hits me.</sup></p>
<p id="L174">It was unlikely that she would be hit here in the presence of people, but that didn't stop Marie from looking into Arondo's eyes.<br><sup>人の目があるこの場で殴られるといったことはないだろうが、それでもマリーはアロンドの目を見ることをやめない。</sup><br><sup>Marie will never stop looking into Alond's eyes, though she will never be beaten in the presence of other people's eyes.</sup></p>

<p id="L177">"I don't know why Master Narson uses such incompetents.

<p id="L179">Arondo spat, then turned his attention to the workers who were still working on the construction and sighed heavily.<br><sup>アロンドは吐き捨てるように言うと、工事作業を続けている労働者に目を向けて大きくため息をついた。</sup><br><sup>Alonde sighed loudly at the workers who were still working on the construction.</sup></p>
<p id="L180">I can clearly see that Marie is not happy with the way she is being treated.<br><sup>マリーが重用されているのが嫌で仕方がない、といった様子がありありと見て取れる。</sup><br><sup>It can be seen clearly that Marie doesn't like being used importantly.</sup></p>

<p id="L185"><br></p>
<p id="L186">After a glance at Marie's mechanical reply, Arondo got back on the wagon and left.<br><sup>機械的に返事をするマリーを<ruby><rb>一瞥</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>いちべつ</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>すると、アロンドは再び荷馬車に乗って去っていった。</sup><br><sup>She glanced at Marie, who was answering mechanically, and then she went away again in the wagon.</sup></p>

<p id="L188">When I moved my feet to go check on the work, my hands shook and I took down the plans.<br><sup>作業の様子を見に行こうと足を動かした時、手が震えて計画書を取り落としてしまった。</sup><br><sup>When I moved my legs to see how the work was going, my hands trembled and I dropped my plan.</sup></p>

<p id="L192">Squatting down, he picked up the plans and held them to his chest, his shoulders shaking as he slumped.<br><sup>しゃがんで計画書を拾って胸に抱き、うつむいたまま肩を震わせる。</sup><br><sup>He squatted down, picked up the plan, held it in his arms, and shook his shoulders with his head down.</sup></p>
