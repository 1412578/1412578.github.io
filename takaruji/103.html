<p id="L1">Since then, I've made a few baths out of the copper and tin bronze that Kazura-san brought me.<br><sup>「あれから、カズラさんが持ってきてくれた銅と錫で青銅を作って、いくつかお風呂を作ったんです」</sup><br><sup>"After that, I made bronze out of copper and tin that Kazura brought me and made several baths."</sup></p>
<p id="L2"><br></p>
<p id="L3">"I don't know much about how to make a Goemon bath, how do you make it?"<br><sup>「五右衛門風呂の作り方って詳しく知らないんですけど、どういうふうに作るんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"I don't know how to make a Goemon bath in detail. How do you make it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L4"><br></p>
<p id="L5">Let's see, I made a mold for the bottom plate shaped like a pot out of sandstone from the mountains, and poured molten bronze into it. ......<br><sup>「えっと、山でとってきた砂岩で鍋みたいな形の底板用の<ruby><rb>鋳型</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>いがた</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>を作って、それに溶かした青銅を流し込んで……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I made a pan-shaped mold of sandstone from the mountains, and poured molten bronze into it..."</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">Baretta speaks happily as she walks toward the mansion.<br><sup>屋敷に向かって歩きながら、バレッタは楽しそうに話す。</sup><br><sup>Valletta talks happily as she walks toward the house.</sup></p>
<p id="L8">The baths were made in collaboration with the villagers, and they understood how to manufacture them.<br><sup>風呂は村人たちと共同で製作したとのことで、製造方法は村人たちも理解しているらしい。</sup><br><sup>The bath was made in collaboration with the villagers, and the villagers seem to understand how to make it.</sup></p>
<p id="L9">The molds are made of sandstone, which can be used over and over again, unlike molds made of clay.<br><sup>鋳型を砂岩製にしたことで、粘土製の鋳型と違って何度も使い回しができる。</sup><br><sup>Unlike clay molds, sandstone molds can be reused many times.</sup></p>
<p id="L10">Kazuyoshi used to bring in 500 kilograms each of copper and tin, the materials for bronze, so he could work on the production without any hesitation.<br><sup>青銅の材料となる銅や錫は、以前一良が５００キロずつ持ち込んでいたので、気兼ねなく製作に取り組めたとのことだ。</sup><br><sup>Since Ichira used to bring 500 kilograms of copper and tin to make bronze materials, he was able to work freely.</sup></p>
<p id="L11"><br></p>
<p id="L12">I've only made a few, and they're still in production."<br><sup>「まだ数個作っただけで、今も生産中なんですけどね」</sup><br><sup>"I've only made a few, and they're still in production."</sup></p>
<p id="L13"><br></p>
<p id="L14">That's great. ...... You're in mass production.<br><sup>「それはすごいですね……量産体制に入ってるのか」</sup><br><sup>"That's amazing... is it in a mass production system?"</sup></p>
<p id="L15"><br></p>
<p id="L16">It's not that big of a deal. We're all making it little by little in our spare time.<br><sup>「そこまで大掛かりなものじゃないですよ。皆で暇を見つけて少しずつ作ってる状態なんで」</sup><br><sup>"It's not that big of a deal.We're all finding time to make it little by little."</sup></p>
<p id="L17"><br></p>
<p id="L18">The other villagers followed them, and when they got close to their houses, they greeted them and went back to their homes.<br><sup>２人の後には他の村人たちも付いてきており、各々の家の近くまで来ると、２人に挨拶をして家へと戻っていった。</sup><br><sup>They were followed by the other villagers, and when they came near each house, they greeted them and went back home.</sup></p>
<p id="L19">Balin remained at the entrance of the village, as he would continue to stand guard at the watchtower as usual.<br><sup>バリンは例のごとく見張り塔で見張りを続けるとのことで、村の入り口に残っている。</sup><br><sup>Balin remains at the entrance of the village, saying he will continue to keep watch on the tower as usual.</sup></p>
<p id="L20"><br></p>
<p id="L21">"I see. ...... Oh, is that the cabin with the bath?"<br><sup>「そうなんですか……あ、お風呂があるのって、あの小屋ですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Is that so... oh, that hut has a bath?"</sup></p>
<p id="L22"><br></p>
<p id="L23">One hut with a triangular roof was built on the site of the house where the villagers were returning.<br><sup>村人が戻っていく家の敷地には、三角屋根の小屋が１軒建てられていた。</sup><br><sup>A hut with a triangular roof was built on the grounds of the house where the villagers returned.</sup></p>
<p id="L24">A dim light was leaking from the entrance, and a fire seemed to be burning inside.<br><sup>入り口からはぼんやりと灯りが漏れており、中では火が焚かれているようだ。</sup><br><sup>There was a dim light leaking from the entrance, and a fire seemed to be burning inside.</sup></p>
<p id="L25"><br></p>
<p id="L26">"Yes. So I built a hut and a washing place inside.<br><sup>「はい。せっかくなので、小屋を建てて中に洗い場も作っちゃいました」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I built a hut and made a washing place inside."</sup></p>
<p id="L27"><br></p>
<p id="L28">Are you going to build them in all the houses?　You've done a great job."<br><sup>「あれを全部の家に作るんですか？　ずいぶんと立派に作りましたね」</sup><br><sup>"Are you going to make that in all the houses?You made it very well."</sup></p>
<p id="L29"><br></p>
<p id="L30">The hut was solidly built even from a distance, a bit like a log cabin.<br><sup>小屋は遠目に見てもしっかりした造りで、ちょっとしたログハウスのようになっていた。</sup><br><sup>The hut was well-built in the distance, like a little log house.</sup></p>
<p id="L31">A small covered shed is attached to the outside of the hut, and there are piles of firewood cut into reasonable sizes.<br><sup>小屋の外には屋根付きの小さな物置が付いており、手頃な大きさに切られた薪が山積みになっている。</sup><br><sup>Outside the shed is a small shed with a roof and a pile of wood cut into appropriate sizes.</sup></p>
<p id="L32"><br></p>
<p id="L33">I thought, "If I'm going to make something, I have to make it right. I had a lot of wood cut for tax purposes, and thanks to the sawmill, I could mass produce wooden boards, so it wasn't that hard.<br><sup>「せっかく作るなら、ちゃんとしたものを作らなきゃと思って。材料は租税用として切り出した木材が沢山ありましたし、製材機のおかげで木板も量産ができるので、そこまで大変じゃなかったですよ」</sup><br><sup>"If I were to make it, I would have to make something decent.There was a lot of wood cut out for tax purposes, and thanks to the sawmill, we could mass-produce wooden boards, so it wasn't that hard."</sup></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35">You built a sawmill too?<br><sup>「製材機も作ったんですか！？」</sup><br><sup>"Did you make a sawmill?"</sup></p>
<p id="L36"><br></p>
<p id="L37">Kazura peeled his eyes at Baretta's lighthearted remark.<br><sup>軽く言ってのけるバレッタに、一良は目を剥いた。</sup><br><sup>Kazura peeled his eyes at Valletta, who spoke lightly.</sup></p>
<p id="L38">Isteria is also working on a lumber sawing machine, but not even a prototype has been built yet.<br><sup>イステリアでも製材機の製造には取り掛かっているが、まだ試作機すら出来上がっていない。</sup><br><sup>We are also working on lumber machines in the exterior, but we haven't even made a prototype yet.</sup></p>
<p id="L39">Nevertheless, the sawmill is already in operation in the village.<br><sup>それにもかかわらず、すでに村では製材機が稼動状態にあるという。</sup><br><sup>Nevertheless, it is said that the lumber mill is already in operation in the village.</sup></p>
<p id="L40"><br></p>
<p id="L41">We only have one machine, but we are using the prototype that we made. I used a single-blade saw made by a villager to make a vertical sawmill (a saw with blades that move up and down).<br><sup>「１機だけですけど、出来上がった試作品をそのまま使っています。村の人に作ってもらった片刃ノコギリを使って、縦型製材機（刃が上下に往復する製材機）を作りました」</sup><br><sup>"There's only one, but I'm using the prototype as it is.Using a single-edged saw made by the villagers, I made a vertical sawing machine (a saw with blades reciprocating up and down)."</sup></p>
<p id="L42"><br></p>
<p id="L43">Did you make the saws yourselves? Was there anyone who could forge or something?"<br><sup>「ノコギリも自分たちで作ったんですか。鍛造とかできる人っていましたっけ？」</sup><br><sup>"Did we make our own saws?Is there anyone who can forge?"</sup></p>
<p id="L44"><br></p>
<p id="L45">People who had been in the military since the early days of the war took the lead on this. They did some simple repairs on weapons and armor themselves, and they also watched the blacksmiths work. They made a few mistakes, but they made something that was okay. But the blade is bronze, so it's not very durable.<br><sup>「戦争の初期から軍にいた人たちが中心になってやってくれました。武器や防具の簡単な修理は自分たちでやっていたみたいで、鍛冶職人の仕事も見ていたみたいなんです。いくつか失敗しましたけど、まあまあの物を作ってくれましたよ。ただ、刃が青銅なので耐久性に難があるんですけどね」</sup><br><sup>"People who served in the military from the beginning of the war played a central role.They seem to have done simple repairs to weapons and protective equipment by themselves, and they seem to have seen the work of blacksmiths.I've made a few mistakes, but they've made me a decent one, although the blade is bronze, so it's hard to endure."</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">If you've been fighting on the front lines for nearly six years, you've learned to do some things.<br><sup>「６年近くも前線で戦い続けてたら、ある程度のことはできるようになってるんですかね」</sup><br><sup>"If you've been fighting on the front for almost six years, you'll be able to do some things."</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">Maybe so. They also repaired the chisels and other tools used in the village, so they were familiar with them.<br><sup>「そうかもしれないですね。それに、村で使うノミとかの修理もその人たちがやっていたので、小慣れてはいたみたいです」</sup><br><sup>"Perhaps so.Besides, they repaired fleas used in the village, so it seems that they are a little used to it."</sup></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51">Is that sawmill in the village?"<br><sup>「その製材機って、村の中にあるんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Is the sawmill in the village?"</sup></p>
<p id="L52"><br></p>
<p id="L53">"There it is. It's in the shed over there."<br><sup>「ありますよ。あそこの小屋の中です」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, in that hut over there."</sup></p>
<p id="L54"><br></p>
<p id="L55">I looked in the direction Baretta was pointing and saw the moonlit hut in the distance.<br><sup>バレッタが指差す方向に目を向けると、月明かりに照らされた小屋が遠目に見えた。</sup><br><sup>When I looked in the direction Valletta pointed, I saw the moonlight-lit hut in the distance.</sup></p>
<p id="L56">There seemed to be two water wheels set up a little farther away from the hut.<br><sup>小屋から少し離れた場所には、水車が２台設置されているようだ。</sup><br><sup>Two watermills seem to have been installed a little far from the hut.</sup></p>
<p id="L57">The waterwheel seemed to be larger than the one used at the riverbank, with a wheel diameter of nearly five meters.<br><sup>その水車は川べりで使っていた物よりも大きいようで、車輪の直径が５メートル近くはあるように見える。</sup><br><sup>The waterwheel seems to be larger than the one used on the riverbank and the wheel looks nearly five meters in diameter.</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">"There's a very large waterwheel. Is it a waterwheel powering a sawmill?"<br><sup>「何やらずいぶんと大きな水車がありますね。製材機の動力水車ですか？」</sup><br><sup>"There are some very large water-mills.Is it the power turbine of the sawmill?"</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">No, that's a pumping waterwheel that feeds water to the power waterwheel. We wanted to use a waterwheel for the sawmill."<br><sup>「いえ、あれは動力水車に水を送るための揚水水車です。製材機には<ruby><rb>上掛</rb><rp>（</rp><rt>うわがけ</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>水車を使いたかったので」</sup><br><sup>"No, that's a pumped water turbine to send water to a power turbine.I wanted to use a waterwheel for the sawmill."</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63">As I stared into the darkness, I could see a water channel set up next to the waterwheel to catch the water.<br><sup>暗闇に目を凝らしてみると、その水車の横に水受け用の水路が設置されているのが見えた。</sup><br><sup>When I looked into the darkness, I saw a waterway next to the waterwheel.</sup></p>
<p id="L64">The waterway extends toward the hut, so I guess that's where the power waterwheel is installed.<br><sup>水路は小屋に向かって延びているので、そこに動力水車が設置されているのだろう。</sup><br><sup>The waterway runs toward the shed, so there must be a power turbine there.</sup></p>
<p id="L65"><br></p>
<p id="L66">A waterwheel is a waterwheel in which water is applied to the wheel from above.<br><sup>上掛水車とは、水車の車輪に上方向から水を掛けて使う水車のことだ。</sup><br><sup>A waterwheel is a waterwheel used by sprinkling water on the wheels of a waterwheel.</sup></p>
<p id="L67">The wheels turn with the weight of the water that is applied from above, and the water that is received keeps holding the water to the lowest position of the waterwheel.<br><sup>上から掛けられる水の重さで車輪が回り、受けた水は水車の最下位置まで水を保持し続ける。</sup><br><sup>The wheel turns under the weight of the water sprinkled from above, and the water received continues to hold the water to the lowest position of the mill.</sup></p>
<p id="L68">This makes it more efficient to work and produces higher horsepower.<br><sup>そのため、作業効率がよく高馬力が出る。</sup><br><sup>As a result, it is efficient and has high horsepower.</sup></p>
<p id="L69">The lower waterwheel used for pumping water does not produce enough horsepower for its size, so the upper waterwheel is preferable to the lower waterwheel for powering machines that require a lot of power, such as lumbering machines.<br><sup>揚水に使っている下掛水車は大きさの割りに馬力が出ないので、製材機などの大きな力を必要とする機械の動力としては、下掛水車よりも上掛水車が望ましい。</sup><br><sup>Since the underwater turbine used for pumping does not produce horsepower for its size, it is desirable to use an overwater turbine rather than a underwater turbine as the power of a machine that requires a lot of force such as a sawmill.</sup></p>
<p id="L70"><br></p>
<p id="L71">"How did you make it in such a short period of time? ...... Were there any plans for the waterwheel?"<br><sup>「この短期間でよく作りましたね……上掛水車の設計図ってありましたっけ？」</sup><br><sup>"You made it well in this short period of time... did you design a water turbine?"</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">There was literature with brief descriptions, but no detailed blueprints. So, I got a little creative and drew the plans myself. Thanks to the drawing board that Kazura-san gave me, I was able to draw a beautiful drawing.<br><sup>「簡単な説明が書いてある文献はあったんですけど、詳細な設計図はなかったですね。なので、少し工夫して自分で図面を引いてしまいました。カズラさんに貰った製図板のおかげで、綺麗な図面が引けましたよ」</sup><br><sup>"There was a literature with a brief explanation, but there was no detailed blueprint, so I drew the drawing myself with a little ingenuity.Thanks to the drawing board Kazura gave me, I was able to draw a beautiful drawing."</sup></p>
<p id="L74"><br></p>
<p id="L75">"Oh, really?"<br><sup>「そ、そうですか」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, is that so?"</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">Nodding at Baretta's words, Kazura looked around the village.<br><sup>バレッタの言葉に頷きながら、一良は村を見渡した。</sup><br><sup>Nodding to Valletta's words, Ichira looked around the village.</sup></p>
<p id="L78">There were several buildings that had not been there before, and we could see what looked like a breeding shed with a fence almost two meters high.<br><sup>今までなかった建物がいくつか建っており、２メートル近い高さの柵がついた飼育小屋のようなものも見える。</sup><br><sup>There are several buildings that have never existed before, and you can see something like a breeding shed with a fence almost two meters high.</sup></p>
<p id="L79">It seems that while I've been away for a while, the village of Grisea has grown tremendously.<br><sup>しばらく留守にしているうちに、グリセア村は驚異的な発展を遂げてしまったようだ。</sup><br><sup>In his absence for a while, the village of Glycer seems to have achieved remarkable development.</sup></p>
<p id="L80"><br></p>
<p id="L81">Is that a breeding shed of some kind?　It's pretty big.<br><sup>「あれって何かの飼育小屋ですか？　ずいぶんと大きいですけど」</sup><br><sup>"What kind of shed is that?"It's very big."</sup></p>
<p id="L82"><br></p>
<p id="L83">That's a breeding shed for root-cutting birds. Since we started feeding them Japanese feed, the birds have become so energetic that they jump over low fences to escape.<br><sup>「あれは根切り鳥の飼育小屋です。日本の飼料を食べさせるようになってから鳥たちが元気になりすぎちゃって、低い柵だと飛び越えて逃げちゃうんです」</sup><br><sup>"That's a roosting bird shed.Since I started feeding them Japanese feed, the birds have become so energetic that they jump over low fences and run away."</sup></p>
<p id="L84"><br></p>
<p id="L85">What, does that bird bounce?"<br><sup>「えっ、あの鳥って跳ねるんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, does that bird jump?"</sup></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">When Kazuyoshi was taking care of the root-cutting birds before, he had the impression that they were extremely mild-mannered chickens.<br><sup>以前一良が根切り鳥の世話をしていた時は、極めて温厚なニワトリのような印象だった。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira used to take care of root-cutting birds, she had the impression that they were very gentle chickens.</sup></p>
<p id="L88">He seldom jumped or ran around, and even if he did, the most he could do was jump ten centimeters.<br><sup>滅多に飛び跳ねたり走り回ったりせず、例え飛び跳ねたとしても10センチがせいぜいだったのだ。</sup><br><sup>He rarely jumped or ran around, and even if he did, he could only jump 10 centimeters.</sup></p>
<p id="L89"><br></p>
<p id="L90">I didn't know they could jump that far either, so I was surprised when I saw them for the first time. Maybe they're like us, with stronger bodies."<br><sup>「私もあそこまで跳ねるなんて知らなくて、初めて見た時はびっくりしました。たぶん私たちみたいに、身体が強化されてるんだと思います」</sup><br><sup>"I didn't know I could jump that far, so I was surprised when I first saw it.I think he's probably strengthened like us."</sup></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">"Hmm, so it's not just humans that are enhanced, but animals as well? Aren't they getting huge?"<br><sup>「ふむ、やはり人間だけじゃなくて動物も強化されるのか。巨大化はしてないですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, not only humans but also animals will be strengthened.Isn't it huge?"</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94">It's just that they've gotten really healthy, but they're still the same size. They're laying lots of eggs, and some chicks have been born.<br><sup>「ものすごく元気になったってだけで、大きさはそのままですね。卵も沢山産んでくれますし、雛も何羽か産まれましたよ」</sup><br><sup>"It's just that I'm feeling a lot better, and it's the same size.They lay a lot of eggs, and they lay a few chicks."</sup></p>
<p id="L95"><br></p>
<p id="L96">"Oh, that's good. I'll have to make sure he doesn't get away."<br><sup>「おお、それはよかった。逃げられないようにしないとですね」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that's a relief.We have to make sure that we can't escape."</sup></p>
<p id="L97"><br></p>
<p id="L98">When they escaped before, it was amazing. When I woke up in the morning and went to get the eggs, two of them jumped all at once, climbed over the fence, and ran away at a great speed.<br><sup>「前に逃げ出した時はすごかったですよ。朝起きて卵を取りに行ったら、２羽が一斉に飛び跳ねて柵を乗り越えて、すごい速さで逃げて行っちゃったんです」</sup><br><sup>"It was amazing when I ran away before.When I got up in the morning and went to pick up the eggs, the two of them jumped over the fence at the same time and ran away at a great speed."</sup></p>
<p id="L99"><br></p>
<p id="L100">"Well, you look like a chicken. ...... Did you catch it?"<br><sup>「ま、まるでニワトリみたいだな……捕まえられたんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, it's like a chicken... have you caught it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">I couldn't catch it at all because it was so tough. ...... In the end, it escaped into the forest, but there didn't seem to be any good food in the forest, so it came back in the evening, looking sad.<br><sup>「それがすばしっこくって全然捕まえられなくて……結局森の中に逃げられちゃったんですけど、美味しいご飯が森にはなかったみたいで、夕方になったらしょんぼりして戻ってきました」</sup><br><sup>"I couldn't catch it at all because it was so quick... in the end, I was able to escape into the forest, but there seemed to be no delicious food in the forest, so I came back depressed in the evening."</sup></p>
<p id="L103"><br></p>
<p id="L104">While talking about this, they returned to the mansion.<br><sup>そんなことを話しながら、２人は屋敷に戻っていった。</sup><br><sup>As they spoke, they went back to the house.</sup></p>
<p id="L105"><br></p>
<p id="L106"><br></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">"I see, that's how a Goemon bath works."<br><sup>「なるほど、五右衛門風呂ってこうなってるのか」</sup><br><sup>"I see, this is what Goemon Bath looks like."</sup></p>
<p id="L109"><br></p>
<p id="L110">Soaking in the Goemon bath, which was shaped like a large water bucket, Kazuyoshi checked the construction of the bath.<br><sup>大きな水桶のような形をした五右衛門風呂に浸かりながら、一良は風呂の造りを確認していた。</sup><br><sup>While soaking in the Goemon bath shaped like a large bucket, Ichira was checking the structure of the bath.</sup></p>
<p id="L111">The sides of the bath are made of wood, and it seems that bronze is only used for the bottom part.<br><sup>風呂の側面は木製でできており、青銅が使われているのは底の部分だけのようだ。</sup><br><sup>The side of the bath is made of wood, and bronze seems to be used only at the bottom.</sup></p>
<p id="L112">A wooden board is placed on top of the bottom plate so that the feet do not directly touch the metal parts.<br><sup>底板の上には木板が敷かれており、金属部分に直接足が触れないようになっている。</sup><br><sup>Wooden boards are laid on the base plate so that feet do not touch the metal parts directly.</sup></p>
<p id="L113">There was a large stone placed on top of the board to keep it from floating away.<br><sup>板の上には大きな石が載せられていて、板が浮き上がらないようになっていた。</sup><br><sup>There was a large stone on the board so that the board wouldn't float.</sup></p>
<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115">There's also a hole in the wall for smoke exhaust. There's also a washroom, so it's pretty well built."<br><sup>「壁に排煙用の穴も付いてるのか。洗い場もあるし、ずいぶんしっかり作ってあるな」</sup><br><sup>"Is there a smoke-exhaust hole in the wall?"There's a washing place, and it's very well made."</sup></p>
<p id="L116"><br></p>
<p id="L117">The floor of the room was mortared, and wooden boards with clogs were laid on top of it.<br><sup>室内の床はモルタルで固めてあり、その上に下駄を履かせた木の板が敷かれている。</sup><br><sup>The indoor floor is made of mortar and wooden boards with clogs on them.</sup></p>
<p id="L118">There was also a drainage ditch dug into the floor, which seemed to extend outward from the house.<br><sup>床には排水用の溝も掘ってあり、屋敷の外に向かって延びていっているようだ。</sup><br><sup>There was also a ditch on the floor for drainage, which seemed to extend toward the outside of the house.</sup></p>
<p id="L119"><br></p>
<p id="L120">I stood up in the bath and looked out through a small window on the wall.<br><sup>風呂の中で立ち上がり、壁についている小窓から外を覗いてみる。</sup><br><sup>Stand up in the bath and look out through a small window on the wall.</sup></p>
<p id="L121">Outside the hut, the smoke from the firewood stretched toward the sky.<br><sup>小屋の外では、薪の煙がもくもくと天に向かって伸びていた。</sup><br><sup>Outside the hut, smoke of wood was rolling up into the sky.</sup></p>
<p id="L122">The lights of the houses in the distance appear to be floating in the village in dots.<br><sup>遠目に見える家々の灯りが、点々と村の中に浮かんで見える。</sup><br><sup>The distant lights of houses floated through the village.</sup></p>
<p id="L123"><br></p>
<p id="L124">Kazura-san, how is the water temperature?"<br><sup>「カズラさん、湯加減はどうですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Mr. Kazura, how's the water?"</sup></p>
<p id="L125"><br></p>
<p id="L126">As Kazuyoshi was looking outside, Baretta appeared from the window.<br><sup>一良が外を眺めていると、窓の外からバレッタが顔を見せた。</sup><br><sup>As Ichira looked out, Valletta looked out of the window.</sup></p>
<p id="L127"><br></p>
