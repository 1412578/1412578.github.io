<p id="L1">Two nights later.<br><sup>２日後の夜。</sup><br><sup>Two nights later.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">A little after dinner time, Kazuyoshi and his group arrived at the square of the Narson residence.<br><sup>夕食時を少し過ぎた頃に、一良たち一行はナルソン邸の広場に到着した。</sup><br><sup>Shortly after dinner, Ichira and his party arrived at the square of Naruson's residence.</sup></p>
<p id="L3">The square is usually deserted at this time of day, but today there were strangely many carriages parked.<br><sup>いつもこの時間帯には広場は閑散としているのだが、今日は妙に多くの馬車が停まっている。</sup><br><sup>It's always quiet in the square at this time of day, but there's a lot of horse-drawn cars parked today.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">There seemed to be a lot of traffic coming in and out of the house, and we saw some people running into the house.<br><sup>屋敷への出入りも激しいようで、小走りで屋敷へ入っていく者たちも幾人か見られた。</sup><br><sup>There seemed to be a strong entry and exit of the house, and some people trotted into it.</sup></p>
<p id="L5">As Kazura, who had gotten off the carriage first, was helping Baretta and Lise who were coming down later, Narson came out from inside the mansion to greet them.<br><sup>先に馬車を降りた一良が後から降りてくるバレッタやリーゼに手を貸していると、屋敷の中からナルソンが出迎えに出てきた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira, who got out of the carriage first, was helping Valletta and Liese, who came down after him, Naruson came out from the house to meet him.</sup></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">"Kazura-dono, thank you for your hard work. You're back very early. ...... What's with the bandage on your head?"<br><sup>「カズラ殿、お疲れ様でした。ずいぶんとお早いお帰りで……その頭の包帯は？」</sup><br><sup>"Good work, Kazura.You've come home so early... what about the bandage on your head?"</sup></p>
<p id="L8"><br></p>
<p id="L9">"But then I got a little injured and cut myself.<br><sup>「それが、ちょっと怪我をして切ってしまいまして」</sup><br><sup>"But I got hurt a little and cut it off."</sup></p>
<p id="L10"><br></p>
<p id="L11">When Ichiran replied, Narson raised his eyebrows in slight surprise.<br><sup>一良が答えると、ナルソンは少し驚いたように眉を上げた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira answered, Naruson raised his eyebrows a little surprised.</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">"Oh, I see. Is your wound okay?"<br><sup>「なんと、そうでしたか。傷の具合は大丈夫ですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, my God, I see.Is the wound all right?"</sup></p>
<p id="L14"><br></p>
<p id="L15">"Yes, I'm fine, it's not a serious injury. More importantly, you seem to be in a flurry of activity, is something wrong?"<br><sup>「ええ、大した怪我じゃないので大丈夫です。それより、何だかばたばたしているようですが、何かあったんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, it's not a serious injury, so it's all right.You seem to be in a state of confusion, but what happened?"</sup></p>
<p id="L16"><br></p>
<p id="L17">Kazuyoshi said as he watched the servants hurrying in and out of the house.<br><sup>せわしなく屋敷を出入りしている使用人たちを見ながら、一良が言う。</sup><br><sup>Kazura says, looking at the servants rushing in and out of the house.</sup></p>
<p id="L18"><br></p>
<p id="L19">"But it was suddenly decided to hold a 'New Year's Eve party' in my territory. We have mobilized all of our civil servants and servants and are hurriedly making preparations.<br><sup>「それが、急に『年越しの宴』を我が領で開くことになってしまいましてな。文官や使用人を総動員して、大急ぎで準備に取り掛かっているところなのです」</sup><br><sup>`and it was suddenly decided that the New Year's feast would be held in our territory.We are mobilizing all the civil servants and servants to make preparations."</sup></p>
<p id="L20"><br></p>
<p id="L21">"A New Year's Eve party?　...... Oh, I think it's the one where all the important people in the country get together and greet each other throughout the night.<br><sup>「年越しの宴？　……ああ、確か国中の有力者が集まって夜通し挨拶合戦を繰広げるっていうやつでしたっけ」</sup><br><sup>"A New Year's party? ... oh, I think it was a party where influential people from all over the country gathered and had a greeting battle all night."</sup></p>
<p id="L22"><br></p>
<p id="L23">"It was supposed to be held in Gregorian territory this year. In terms of the order, this year's banquet was supposed to be held in Gregorian territory, but a messenger came to me saying that due to the effects of the famine in the summer, the banquet would be held in Istair territory. I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it.<br><sup>「ま、まあ、そのような感じの宴会ですな。順番的には今年はグレゴルン領で開催するはずだったのですが、『どうにも夏場の飢饉の影響で開催がおぼつかないからイステール領に順番を譲りたい』と使者がやってきまして……前々から他領に持ち回りを変えたいという話は出ていたのですが、そこまで酷い状況では断るわけにもいかず、引き受けることにいたしました」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's the sort of banquet.In turn, it was supposed to be held in Gregorne territory this year, but a messenger came and said, 'I would like to give up my order to Istair territory because of the summer famine.'There have been talks about changing hands to other territories, but I couldn't refuse in such a terrible situation."</sup></p>
<p id="L24"><br></p>
<p id="L25">"What, is Gregorian territory in such a bad state?"<br><sup>「えっ、グレゴルン領ってそんなに酷い状態なんですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, is Gregorne so terrible?"</sup></p>
<p id="L26"><br></p>
<p id="L27">"It seems so. Support for our territory has been dropping rapidly, and I'm afraid we have no choice."<br><sup>「そのようです。我が領への支援も急激に落ち込んでおりましたし、仕方がないかと」</sup><br><sup>"It seems so.Support for our territory has fallen sharply, and I wonder if it can be helped."</sup></p>
<p id="L28"><br></p>
<p id="L29">From Narson's story and the contents of the documents, Kazuyoshi knew that the amount of food aid from the Gregorian territory had dropped drastically.<br><sup>グレゴルン領からの食料支援量が急激に落ち込んでいるという話は、一良もナルソンの話と資料の内容から把握していた。</sup><br><sup>The story of a sudden decline in food aid from Gregorian territory was also understood by Narson's story and data.</sup></p>
<p id="L30">But I didn't expect them to be so needy.<br><sup>だが、それほどまでに困窮しているとは予想外だった。</sup><br><sup>But I didn't expect him to be so poor.</sup></p>
<p id="L31">Besides, this story seems to be too sudden, no matter how much it is.<br><sup>それに、いくらなんでも今回の話は急すぎるようにも思える。</sup><br><sup>Besides, whatever it may be, it seems too hasty to talk about this time.</sup></p>
<p id="L32"><br></p>
<p id="L33">"I see. ...... But why is it Istair territory of all places?"<br><sup>「そうですか……しかし、何でよりによってイステール領なんですかね？」</sup><br><sup>"I see... but why is it Istair's territory?"</sup></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35">"I'm sorry to say this, but the rapid recovery of our territory is quite extraordinary to say the least. The lords and royalty of other realms are probably planning to use the feast as an opportunity to see for themselves what kind of condition we are actually in. Perhaps, the request was made by the Royal Capital to the Gregorian territory.<br><sup>「私が言うのもなんですが、我が領の急速な復興ぶりははっきり言って異常ですからな。実際どんな状態なのか、宴を名目に他領の領主や王族たちは自分の目で確認するつもりなのでしょう。おそらくですが、王都からグレゴルン領に働きかけもあっての今回の要請なのではと思います」</sup><br><sup>"As I say, the rapid reconstruction of our territory is, frankly, unusual.The lords and royal families of other territories will see for themselves what it is like in the name of a feast.Perhaps this request was made because the royal capital approached Gregorne."</sup></p>
<p id="L36"><br></p>
<p id="L37">"I see. ...... Whatever it is, it's going to be a pain in the ass.<br><sup>「なるほど……何にしろ、めんどくさいことになりそうですね」</sup><br><sup>"I see... it's going to be troublesome anyway."</sup></p>
<p id="L38"><br></p>
<p id="L39">"That's right. Well, let's get around well. By the way, have you eaten yet?"<br><sup>「そうですな。まあ、上手く立ち回りましょう。ところで、食事はお済みですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, let's get around well.By the way, have you finished your meal?"</sup></p>
<p id="L40"><br></p>
<p id="L41">"We haven't eaten yet. We're all starving, so if you could hurry up and prepare some food."<br><sup>「まだ食べてないんです。皆腹ペコなんで、急いで用意していただけると」</sup><br><sup>"I haven't eaten yet.They are all hungry, so please hurry up and get ready."</sup></p>
<p id="L42"><br></p>
<p id="L43">"The bath is ready. The bath is ready, so why don't you go ahead and take it?"<br><sup>「では、すぐに用意させましょう。風呂の用意はできておりますので、先に入ってしまっては？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I'll have it ready at once.The bath is ready, so why don't you take it first?"</sup></p>
<p id="L44"><br></p>
<p id="L45">"Yes, I will."<br><sup>「そうですね、そうさせてもらいます」</sup><br><sup>"Well, I'll do that,"</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">Thus, once the conversation was over, we decided to have dinner after the bath.<br><sup>こうして一旦話は切り上げ、風呂の後で食事をすることになった。</sup><br><sup>Thus, the conversation ended, and we decided to eat after the bath.</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49"><br></p>
<p id="L50"><br></p>
<p id="L51">After dinner, Kazuyoshi gathered everyone in the workroom next to his room and spread out the souvenirs on the table.<br><sup>夕食後、一良は自室の隣にある仕事部屋に皆を集め、テーブルにお土産を広げていた。</sup><br><sup>After dinner, Ichira gathered everyone in the working room next to his room and spread souvenirs on the table.</sup></p>
<p id="L52">Eira and Marie were also seated, but Marie looked uncomfortable and shrunk back in fear.<br><sup>エイラとマリーも席についているのだが、マリーは落ち着かないのか恐縮した様子で縮こまっている。</sup><br><sup>Ayla and Marie are also sitting down, but Marie shrinks in awe, perhaps because she feels uncomfortable.</sup></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54">"Yes, this is Baretta. This one is Lise."<br><sup>「はい、これはバレッタさん。こっちはリーゼ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, this is Valletta.This is Liese."</sup></p>
<p id="L55"><br></p>
<p id="L56">I handed each of them one of the elegant paulownia boxes.<br><sup>上品な桐の箱を、それぞれに１つずつ手渡す。</sup><br><sup>Hand over one elegant paulownia box to each.</sup></p>
<p id="L57">When Liese received the box, her eyes sparkled with anticipation.<br><sup>リーゼは箱を受け取ると、期待に瞳を輝かせた。</sup><br><sup>When Liese received the box, her eyes sparkled with anticipation.</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">"Can I open it?"<br><sup>「開けてもいい？」</sup><br><sup>"Can I open it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L60"><br></p>
<p id="L61">"I'm with you.<br><sup>「おうよ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes,"</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63">At his reply, everyone opens the lid at once.<br><sup>その返事に、皆が一斉にフタを開ける。</sup><br><sup>Everyone opened the lid at the same time.</sup></p>
<p id="L64"><br></p>
<p id="L65">"Oh my God!　What is this?<br><sup>「わあっ！？　なにこれすごい！！」</sup><br><sup>"Wow!? What's this?"</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">Lise was astonished to see two blue Edo faceted tumblers peeking out from inside.<br><sup>中から覗いた２つの青い江戸切子のタンブラーに、リーゼは驚愕の声を上げた。</sup><br><sup>Liese exclaimed with astonishment at the two blue Edo Kiriko tumblers peeping from inside.</sup></p>
<p id="L68">I had hoped for a clear blue glass cup, but I hadn't expected it to be so finely crafted.<br><sup>透き通った青色のガラスコップと予め希望はしていたが、まさかここまで細かい細工が施されているとは予想していなかったからだ。</sup><br><sup>I had hoped in advance for a transparent blue glass cup, but I didn't expect such fine work.</sup></p>
<p id="L69">I bought a set of two of the same color with different patterns.<br><sup>それぞれ、同色の模様の違った物が２つ入って１セットのものを買ってきた。</sup><br><sup>I bought a set of two different designs of the same color.</sup></p>
<p id="L70">Incidentally, the price is about 20,000 yen for the set.<br><sup>ちなみに、価格はセットで２万円ほどのものだ。</sup><br><sup>By the way, the set price is about 20,000 yen.</sup></p>
<p id="L71">It is also prepared for Isaac and Havel, and Marie will deliver it to Havel tomorrow.<br><sup>アイザックとハベルにも用意してあり、ハベルにはマリーが明日届けることになっている。</sup><br><sup>Isaac and Hubbard also have it, and Hubbard will have Marie deliver it tomorrow.</sup></p>
<p id="L72">Havel had been supervising the work on the new land, so he had been shuttling back and forth between home and the field, and rarely came to the Narson residence.<br><sup>ハベルはここ最近ずっと新たな開墾地での作業監督をしているため、自宅と現場を往復していてナルソン邸に来ることは稀だからだ。</sup><br><sup>Havel has been working on new landfills lately, so it is rare for him to come back and forth between his home and the site to visit Naruson's house.</sup></p>
<p id="L73"><br></p>
<p id="L74">"It's so beautiful. ...... It's like a jewel.<br><sup>「すごく綺麗ですね……まるで宝石みたい」</sup><br><sup>"It's so beautiful... it's like a jewel."</sup></p>
<p id="L75"><br></p>
<p id="L76">Baretta exclaimed in admiration as she picked up an orange tumbler and held it up to the LED lights pouring down from the ceiling.<br><sup>オレンジ色のタンブラーを手に取り、天井から降り注ぐＬＥＤライトの光にかざしながらバレッタが感嘆の声を漏らす。</sup><br><sup>With an orange tumbler in his hand, Valletta exclaims as he basks in the light of LED lights falling from the ceiling.</sup></p>
<p id="L77">Zirconia also picked up the red tumbler and let out an impressed "Oh.<br><sup>ジルコニアも赤いタンブラーを手に取り、「おー」と感心した声を漏らしていた。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia also picked up a red tumbler and exclaimed with admiration.</sup></p>
<p id="L78">Marie froze in her position with the lid off, staring at the pretty pink tumbler.<br><sup>マリーはフタを外した体勢のまま、ピンク色のかわいらしいタンブラーを見つめて固まってしまっている。</sup><br><sup>Marie looks at the cute pink tumbler with the lid off.</sup></p>
<p id="L79">Perhaps it was because Eira was used to seeing glass teapots, but she didn't seem that surprised.<br><sup>エイラはよくガラスのティーポットを見ているせいか、恐縮した様子ながらもそこまで驚いているふうではない。</sup><br><sup>Perhaps because Ayla often looks at the glass teapots, she looks embarrassed but doesn't look so surprised.</sup></p>
<p id="L80"><br></p>
<p id="L81">"What are you talking about? It's glass, it's not jewelry."<br><sup>「何言ってるの。ガラスなんだから宝石じゃない」</sup><br><sup>"What are you talking about?It's glass, so it's not a jewel."</sup></p>
<p id="L82"><br></p>
<p id="L83">"It's also true. ...... So does that mean this is a cup made of jewels? It's also of the highest quality."<br><sup>「それもそうですね。……ということは、これは宝石で作ったコップってことですか。それも最高級品質の」</sup><br><sup>"That's true, too.Do you mean this cup is made of jewels?It's of the highest quality."</sup></p>
<p id="L84"><br></p>
<p id="L85">"When you think about it, it's a hell of a lot better than ......."<br><sup>「そう考えると、とんでもない代物よねこれ……」</sup><br><sup>"Now that you think about it, it's a terrible thing, isn't it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">"Yes. ......<br><sup>「そうですね……」</sup><br><sup>"Well..."</sup></p>
<p id="L88"><br></p>
<p id="L89">Lise and Baretta stared at them in their hands and gulped.<br><sup>リーゼとバレッタは手にしたそれらを見つめ、ごくりと息を飲んでいる。</sup><br><sup>Liese and Valletta look at them and take a deep breath.</sup></p>
<p id="L90"><br></p>
<p id="L91">"And this one for Zirconia. It's a plate for shaved ice."<br><sup>「あと、ジルコニアさんにはこれも。カキ氷用のお皿です」</sup><br><sup>"And for Mr. Zirconia, too.It's a plate for shaved ice."</sup></p>
<p id="L92"><br></p>
<p id="L93">Zirconia smiled happily as I handed her a crystal clear red oyster dish.<br><sup>透き通った赤色のカキ氷皿を渡すと、ジルコニアは嬉しそうに微笑んだ。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia smiled happily as she handed him a transparent red shaved ice plate.</sup></p>
<p id="L94"><br></p>
<p id="L95">"Well, thank you very much. I'll start using it today."<br><sup>「まあ、ありがとうございます。さっそく今日から使わせていただきますね」</sup><br><sup>"Well, thank you very much.I'll use it from today."</sup></p>
<p id="L96"><br></p>
<p id="L97">"You're starting today?<br><sup>「き、今日からですか」</sup><br><sup>"To-day, sir,"</sup></p>
<p id="L98"><br></p>
<p id="L99">"Yes, this plate will make your shaved ice taste better than ever. ...... Narson, what's wrong?"<br><sup>「はい、このお皿なら今まで以上にカキ氷が美味しく食べられそうです……ナルソン、どうしたの？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I think I can eat shaved ice more deliciously on this plate than ever before... Narson, what's wrong?"</sup></p>
<p id="L100"><br></p>
<p id="L101">Noticing that Narson was frozen while looking into the box, Zirconia looked into the box from the side.<br><sup>箱の中を覗いたまま固まっているナルソンに気付き、ジルコニアが横から箱を覗き込む。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia peeps into the box from the side when she notices Narson, who is still solidifying.</sup></p>
<p id="L102"><br></p>
<p id="L103">"Oh, my God, that's amazing."<br><sup>「えっ、なにそれすごい」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, what's that?"</sup></p>
<p id="L104"><br></p>
<p id="L105">"What's going on?"<br><sup>「どうしたのですか？」</sup><br><sup>"What's the matter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L106"><br></p>
<p id="L107">Zirconia's eyes widen, and Lise tilts her head.<br><sup>目を見開くジルコニアに、リーゼが小首を傾げる。</sup><br><sup>Liese tilts her head slightly at zirconia, which opens her eyes.</sup></p>
<p id="L108"><br></p>
<p id="L109">"It's an amazing thing. ...... I didn't know such a thing existed. ......<br><sup>「な、なんともすさまじい代物ですな……こんなものが存在するとは……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, what a terrible thing it is... I can't believe this exists..."</sup></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111">Narson took it out of the box as he said this.<br><sup>ナルソンはそう言いながら、箱からそれを取り出した。</sup><br><sup>Narson took it out of the box, saying so.</sup></p>
<p id="L112"><br></p>
<p id="L113">"Oh, my God."<br><sup>「わっ、すごい」</sup><br><sup>"Wow, that's amazing."</sup></p>
<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115">"It's beautiful. ......"<br><sup>「綺麗です……」</sup><br><sup>"It's beautiful..."</sup></p>
<p id="L116"><br></p>
<p id="L117">Liese and Baretta let out a squeal of surprise at the beauty of it.<br><sup>その美しさに、リーゼとバレッタが驚きの声を漏らした。</sup><br><sup>Liese and Valletta were surprised at the beauty.</sup></p>
<p id="L118">It was a rocks glass made up of two colors, amber and green.<br><sup>それは、琥珀色と緑色の２色で構成されたロックグラスだった。</sup><br><sup>It was a rock glass consisting of two colors: amber and green.</sup></p>
<p id="L119">The bottom is a dark amber color, with a gradation of green and amber in the middle, and darker green as it moves toward the edge.<br><sup>底面は濃い琥珀色をしており、中ほどは緑色と琥珀色のグラデーション、そこからふち側に進むにつれて濃い緑色となっている。</sup><br><sup>The bottom is dark amber, with a green and amber gradation in the middle, and dark green as it moves toward the edge.</sup></p>
<p id="L120">Like the tumblers in the hands of the other people, they were also decorated with detailed Edo faceting.<br><sup>他の面々が手にしているタンブラーと同様に、細かな江戸切子の細工も施されていた。</sup><br><sup>Like the tumblers that other people had, fine Edo-kiriko was also made.</sup></p>
<p id="L121">The price is 30,000 yen for a single item, which is a little higher than what everyone else is getting.<br><sup>値段は単品で３万円と、皆が手にしているものより少しお高めだ。</sup><br><sup>The price is 30,000 yen for a single item, a little higher than everyone else's.</sup></p>
<p id="L122"><br></p>
<p id="L123">"I forgot to ask Mr. Naruson what color he wanted, so I brought him one that I thought would be good for him. It's beautiful, isn't it?<br><sup>「何色がいいかナルソンさんに聞いておくの忘れちゃってたんで、私的によさげなのを見繕って持ってきました。綺麗ですよねそれ」</sup><br><sup>"I forgot to ask Mr. Narson what color he wanted, so I brought it with me as if it were private.It's pretty, isn't it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L124"><br></p>
<p id="L125">"Well, yes. But are you sure you don't mind if I take such an item?"<br><sup>「は、はい。しかし、これほどの品物、本当にいただいてもよろしいのですか？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, sir, but would you really like to have such a thing?"</sup></p>
<p id="L126"><br></p>
<p id="L127">"Please do. It's my way of thanking you for being so good to me."<br><sup>「どうぞどうぞ。いつもよくしてもらっているお礼ですから」</sup><br><sup>"Go ahead.It's just that I'm always treated you well."</sup></p>
<p id="L128"><br></p>
<p id="L129">"Thank you very much. However, it is people like us who are well treated. ......"<br><sup>「ありがとうございます。しかし、よくしてもらっているのは私どものような……」</sup><br><sup>"Thank you very much.But it's like us who are treated well..."</sup></p>
<p id="L130"><br></p>
<p id="L131">"Well, well, well."<br><sup>「まあまあ、いいじゃないですか」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's all right,"</sup></p>
<p id="L132"><br></p>
<p id="L133">Afterwards, we decided to have something to drink, so Narson brought a few bottles of his "special" fruit wine in silver bottles from his room and poured them around himself.<br><sup>その後、せっかくだから何か飲もうということになり、ナルソンが自室から銀のボトルに入った「とっておき」の果実酒を数本持ってきて自ら注いで回った。</sup><br><sup>After that, he decided to drink something, and Naruson brought a few bottles of "special" fruit wine from his room and poured them around himself.</sup></p>
<p id="L134">In the center of the table were fruits, salted meat, and other trimmings, making the situation a bit like a banquet.<br><sup>テーブルの中央には果物や肉の塩漬けなどのツマミが並べられ、ちょっとした宴会のような状況になっている。</sup><br><sup>In the middle of the table, there are knobs such as salted fruit and meat, making it look like a little banquet.</sup></p>
<p id="L135">Valletta said that she didn't like to drink, so she drank barley tea instead of fruit wine.<br><sup>バレッタは酒が苦手とのことだったので、果実酒の代わりに麦茶を飲んでいる。</sup><br><sup>Valletta says she doesn't like alcohol, so she drinks barley tea instead of fruit wine.</sup></p>
<p id="L136">While Narson was out of the room, Zirconia made a huge pile of shaved ice and popped it into her mouth as if she was making up for not eating in the past few days.<br><sup>ジルコニアはナルソンが席を外している間に山盛りのカキ氷を作り、ここ数日食べられなかった分を取り返すかのようにもりもりと口に運んでいた。</sup><br><sup>Zirconia made a pile of shaved ice while Narson was away and carried it back to his mouth as if he had regained what he had not eaten in the past few days.</sup></p>
<p id="L137"><br></p>
<p id="L138">"Wow, is the construction going that well?"<br><sup>「ほー、そんなに工事は上手く進んでるんですか」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, is the construction going that well?"</sup></p>
<p id="L139"><br></p>
<p id="L140">"Yes. Since we don't have to laboriously carry the stone from the quarry and process it anymore, we are making progress at a very fast pace. Mortar is much cheaper than stone, and you can fit it into any shape you want, so it's really convenient.<br><sup>「はい。石切り場から苦労して石を運ぶ手間と加工する必要がなくなったので、すさまじい早さで進んでおります。石材より圧倒的に安価なうえに、型にはめれば形状も自由自在とは、モルタルは本当に便利ですな」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, it's going very fast because I don't have to work hard to carry stones from the quarry anymore.It's much cheaper than stone, and mortar is really convenient because it's freely shaped when it's molded."</sup></p>
<p id="L141"><br></p>
<p id="L142">A red-faced Narson replies, shaking the glass as if enjoying the movement of the fruit wine in it.<br><sup>グラスの中の果実酒の動きを楽しむように揺らしながら、赤い顔をしたナルソンが答える。</sup><br><sup>answered Naruson, who was red-faced as he shook the wine in his glass.</sup></p>
<p id="L143">It's only my second drink, but I don't think I'm a very strong drinker.<br><sup>まだ２杯目なのだが、あまり酒に強いほうではないようだ。</sup><br><sup>It's only my second drink, but I don't think I'm a very strong drinker.</sup></p>
<p id="L144">Liese, on the other hand, didn't change her color at all and was gulping it down, saying it was delicious.<br><sup>それに引き換えリーゼは顔色一つ変えず、美味しい美味しいといいながらぐびぐび飲んでいる。</sup><br><sup>On the other hand, Liese gulps while saying it was delicious and delicious without changing her complexion.</sup></p>
<p id="L145"><br></p>
<p id="L146">"It's going so fast, it's going to save us years of construction time. The bouncing vines in particular have been a big help."<br><sup>「あまりにも早く進みすぎて、この分だと年単位で工期が短縮できそうです。特に跳ねつるべが大活躍しております」</sup><br><sup>"It's going so fast that I think I can shorten the construction period by year at this rate.In particular, bouncing cranes are very useful."</sup></p>
<p id="L147"><br></p>
<p id="L148">"What, bouncy vines?"<br><sup>「えっ、跳ねつるべ？」</sup><br><sup>"What, a bouncer?"</sup></p>
<p id="L149"><br></p>
<p id="L150">Narson nodded to Kazuyoshi, who tilted his head, unsure of its purpose.<br><sup>用途が分からず首を傾げる一良に、ナルソンが頷く。</sup><br><sup>Naruson nods to Ichira, who tilts his head because he doesn't know what to do.</sup></p>
<p id="L151"><br></p>
<p id="L152">"A craftsman at the site invented a tool for lifting and lowering loads by modifying a spring-loaded pickaxe. Now we can easily lift and lower things to high places, and our work efficiency has jumped.<br><sup>「現場の職人が跳ねつるべを改造して、荷物の上げ下ろしをする道具を発明しましてな。高所へも簡単に物の上げ下ろしができるようになったので、作業効率が跳ね上がりました」</sup><br><sup>"The craftsman in the field has invented a tool to alter the bouncer and lift and unload.The efficiency of the work has jumped because it is now easy to lift and lower things to high places."</sup></p>
<p id="L153"><br></p>
<p id="L154">"Modification ...... Oh, you're using the seesaw principle to hang things up."<br><sup>「改造……ああ、シーソーの原理で物をつるし上げてるのか」</sup><br><sup>"Modification... Oh, are you hanging things up by seesaw principle?"</sup></p>
<p id="L155"><br></p>
<p id="L156">"Oh, that's called the seesaw principle. I heard that the craftsmen attached a movable base to it so that they could move it anywhere and lift and unload goods.<br><sup>「ほう、あれはシーソーの原理と言うのですか。職人たちはそれに可動式の台座を取り付けて、どこにでもすぐに移動させて荷物の上げ下ろしができるようにしたと聞いております」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, is that the principle of seesaw?"I've heard that the craftsmen have attached a movable pedestal to it so that it can be moved anywhere immediately so that the luggage can be lifted and unloaded."</sup></p>
<p id="L157"><br></p>
<p id="L158">The tool Narson is referring to is a lifting device, similar to a bouncing crucible, in which a post is built in the center of a long pole, a heavy load is tied to one side of the pole, and the other side is pulled to lift the load.<br><sup>ナルソンの言っている道具とは、跳ねつるべと同様に長い棒の中心に支柱を建て、その片側に重い荷物をくくりつけ、もう片側をひっぱって持ち上げる昇降装置のことだ。</sup><br><sup>Narson means a lifting device that, like a bouncing crane, has a support in the center of a long stick, ties a heavy load to one side, and pulls up the other.</sup></p>
<p id="L159">It is probably a human-powered version of the crane trucks used at construction sites in Japan.<br><sup>日本の建築現場などで使われているクレーン車の人力版といったところだろう。</sup><br><sup>It is probably a human-powered version of a crane used in Japanese construction sites.</sup></p>
<p id="L160"><br></p>
<p id="L161">"There are also tools that have been modified to have a handle attached to the wheel, and while turning the wheel, the rope on the wheel is reeled in and the load is lifted little by little. I've heard that it's more convenient and doesn't take up much space, so it's useful in small places.<br><sup>「また、それをさらに改造して、車輪にハンドルをつけて回しながら車輪に乗せた縄を巻き取って少しずつ荷物を持ち上げる道具もあるようです。そちらは場所を食わずに便利だとかで、狭い場所で重宝しているようです」</sup><br><sup>"There seems to be also a tool that can be further modified to put a steering wheel around the wheel and wind up the rope on the wheel and lift the luggage little by little.They say it's convenient and convenient to eat, so it seems to be useful in a small place."</sup></p>
<p id="L162"><br></p>
<p id="L163">"Oh, everyone is working hard. They've even invented various tools, they're so motivated.<br><sup>「おお、みんな頑張ってますね。色々と道具まで発明するなんてやる気満々だなあ」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, everyone is doing their best.I'm very motivated to invent all kinds of tools."</sup></p>
<p id="L164"><br></p>
<p id="L165">"The sooner we finish building the fort, the sooner we can focus on cultivating the area around the fort and flood control in Isteria. The sooner we can get the fort built, the sooner we can focus on cultivating the area around the fort and flood control in Isteria to prepare for war. It will also free up a lot of budget, so it's a good thing.<br><sup>「目立った成果を上げたものには褒美を取らせているので、その影響かと。砦の建築が早く済めば、その分戦時に備えた砦付近の開墾やイステリアの治水工事に注力することができるので大変助かります。予算も大幅に浮きますし、いいこと尽くめですな」</sup><br><sup>"We reward those who have achieved remarkable results, so I think it's because of that.If the construction of the fort is completed quickly, it will be very helpful because we can concentrate on reclamation near the fort and flood control of the esteria.The budget will come up a lot, and everything will be good."</sup></p>
<p id="L166"><br></p>
<p id="L167">"That's right. But the craftsmen are amazing, aren't they? I can't believe they invented such a tool in such a short period of time."<br><sup>「そうですね。しかし、職人さんたちすごいですね。この短期間でそんな道具を発明してしまうなんて」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, but the craftsmen are amazing.I can't believe I invented such a tool in such a short time."</sup></p>
<p id="L168"><br></p>
<p id="L169">"I think I was inspired by the novelty of the machines and tools that Kazura-dono taught me about. There are many more tools that could be developed in the future."<br><sup>「カズラ殿に教えていただいた機械や道具の新規性に刺激されたのだと思います。今後はもっと色々な道具が開発されるかもしれません」</sup><br><sup>"I think I was stimulated by the novelty of the machines and tools that Kazura-dono taught me.More tools may be developed in the future."</sup></p>
<p id="L170"><br></p>
<p id="L171">"That's a good trend. If the site is that motivated, I guess the construction is safe."<br><sup>「それはいい傾向ですね。現場がそこまでやる気をだしてくれてるなら、工事は安泰かな」</sup><br><sup>"That's a good trend.If the site is so enthusiastic, the construction will be safe."</sup></p>
<p id="L172"><br></p>
<p id="L173">"Yes. In addition, we have started to install lumbering machines, so the speed of wood processing is much faster than before, and we expect to be able to reduce the cost significantly. However, the work is progressing so fast that the supply of materials may not be able to keep up, so we have to hurry up with that as well. We don't have enough sand for the mortar, so we crushed a small amount of gravel and mixed it to increase the amount, and it worked well. I'm a little worried about the quality, though.<br><sup>「はい。そのうえ製材機の導入も始まったので、木材加工の速度も今までとは段違いに早くなってきているうえにコストも大幅に削減できる見込みです。ただ、工事の進みが早すぎて材料の供給が追いつかなくなりそうなので、そちらも急がせなければなりません。モルタルの材料に使う砂が足りなくて、試しに量増しするために砂利を細かく粉砕して少量混ぜて作ってみたら上手くいったとかで、誤魔化し誤魔化し作業している状態です。少々品質が心配ですが」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, and with the introduction of sawmills, the speed of wood processing is going to be much faster than before, and the cost will be greatly reduced.However, the construction progress is too fast to catch up with the supply of materials, so we have to hurry up.There was not enough sand to use for mortar materials, so I crushed gravel into small pieces and mixed it up in order to increase the amount, and it worked well, so I'm working on it.I'm a little worried about the quality."</sup></p>
<p id="L174"><br></p>
<p id="L175">"Oh, it's fine. In fact, the strength is increased. I didn't tell you this because I thought it would increase the cost of materials, but if you mix mortar with crushed gravel, it becomes a building material called concrete.<br><sup>「あ、それ大丈夫ですよ。むしろ強度が増してます。材料費がかさむと思って言ってなかったんですが、モルタルに砕いた砂利を混ぜるとコンクリートっていう建築材料になるんですよ」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, that's all right.Rather, it's getting stronger.I didn't say it because I thought it would cost a lot of money, but if you mix the mortar with crushed gravel, it becomes a building material called concrete."</sup></p>
<p id="L176"><br></p>
<p id="L177">"Oh, is that so?　Our craftsmen are quite good at inventing new building materials without us even noticing. I'll have to mass produce the ore crusher as soon as possible and send it out to the field. Hahaha.<br><sup>「む、そうなのですか？　気付かぬうちに新しい建築材料を発明するとは、我が領の職人もなかなかやりますな。これは鉱石粉砕機も早急に量産して現場に送り出さねばなりませんな。ははは」</sup><br><sup>"Well, is that so?It's hard for our artisans to invent new building materials without realizing it.We have to mass-produce the ore crusher and send it to the site as soon as possible.Hahaha."</sup></p>
<p id="L178"><br></p>
<p id="L179">Perhaps it was the alcohol in his system, but Narson was much more excited than usual.<br><sup>酒が入っているせいか、ナルソンはいつもよりだいぶテンションが高い。</sup><br><sup>Maybe it's because of the wine, but Naruson is much more excited than usual.</sup></p>
<p id="L180">He seemed to be in a very good mood, probably because the situation in his territory was going extremely well.<br><sup>領内の状況が頗る上手くいっているせいもあるのか、かなり上機嫌に見えた。</sup><br><sup>Perhaps because the situation in the territory was going very well, he looked very happy.</sup></p>
<p id="L181"><br></p>
<p id="L182">"But if the construction is going so well, I'd like to go see the fort.<br><sup>「しかし、そんなに上手く工事が進んでいるのなら、一度その砦を見に行ってみたいですね」</sup><br><sup>"But if the construction is going so well, I'd like to go and see the fort."</sup></p>
<p id="L183"><br></p>
<p id="L184">"Oh, that would be great. I would be very grateful if you could visit the site. Oh, and by the way, you can use the hand pump I told you about to pump out the abandoned mine with water. ......"<br><sup>「おお、それはありがたい。ぜひ視察していただけると助かります。それとですな、前にお話した手押しポンプを使って水で廃坑を……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, thank you very much.I would appreciate it if you could inspect it.And, you know, with the hand pump I told you before, I'm going to use water to build an abandoned mine..."</sup></p>

<p id="L186">"Hey, hey, let's stop talking about work and talk about something more fun. Come on, Kazura, have some more sake.

Look, Kazura, drink more.It's so delicious."</sup></p>
<p id="L187"><br></p>
<p id="L188">As Narson was about to say this, Lise, who had just taken a seat, put her hand on Kazura's shoulder (the one that wasn't hurt) and offered him a tumbler.<br><sup>ナルソンが言いかけた時、席を立ったリーゼが一良の肩（痛めていないほう）に手を置いてタンブラーを差し出した。</sup><br><sup>When Narson was about to say something, Liese, who left her seat, laid her hand on Ichira's shoulder and held out the tumbler.</sup></p>
<p id="L189">He was unusually a little drunk, and his face was slightly red.<br><sup>珍しく少し酔っ払っているのか、顔がほんのり赤い。</sup><br><sup>His face is a little red, perhaps because he is a little drunk.</sup></p>
<p id="L190"><br></p>
<p id="L191">"Hmm, I see."<br><sup>「ん、そうか」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I see,"</sup></p>
<p id="L192"><br></p>
<p id="L193">Kazuyoshi took it from Lise and took a sip.<br><sup>一良はリーゼからそれを受け取ると一口飲んだ。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira received it from Liese, he took a sip.</sup></p>
<p id="L194">A very elegant, fruity, sweet aroma fills my nostrils.<br><sup>とても上品な、フルーティーな甘い香りが鼻腔に広がる。</sup><br><sup>A very elegant, fruity, sweet scent spreads through the nasal cavity.</sup></p>
<p id="L195">It's very sweet and tastes almost like a dessert wine.<br><sup>甘みが強く、デザートワインに近い味だ。</sup><br><sup>It has a strong sweetness and tastes similar to dessert wine.</sup></p>
<p id="L196"><br></p>
<p id="L197">"Wow, this is good. I've never had a fruit wine this good before. ...... What's wrong?"<br><sup>「うお、美味いなこれ。こんな美味い果実酒は今まで……どうした？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, it's delicious.I've never had such a delicious fruit wine... what's wrong?"</sup></p>
