<p id="L2"><br></p>
<p id="L3">After finishing his breakfast, Kazuyoshi and Lise visited the archives.<br><sup>一良は朝食を済ませた後、リーゼとともに資料室を訪れていた。</sup><br><sup>After breakfast, Ichira visited the archives with Liese.</sup></p>
<p id="L4">Lise, holding a candle, led me slowly through the dimly lit room.<br><sup>手燭を持ったリーゼに先導され、薄暗い室内をゆっくりと進む。</sup><br><sup>Leading by Liese holding a candle, he slowly moves through the dim room.</sup></p>
<p id="L5"><br></p>
<p id="L6">"I'm sure there's a ...... around here. Is it related to the import and export of goods?"<br><sup>「確かこの辺りに……あったあった。物資の輸出入関連でいいの？」</sup><br><sup>"I think there was... around here.Is it all right to import and export goods?"</sup></p>
<p id="L7"><br></p>
<p id="L8">"Yes, it would be nice to have materials that show the amount of resources produced in the territory. Also, I'd like to see materials from other countries, if you have them."<br><sup>「うん、領内の資源の産出量とかも分かる資料があるといいかな。あと、他国の資料もあれば見てみたい」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, it would be nice to have some data on the production of resources in the territory.Also, I'd like to take a look at other countries' materials."</sup></p>
<p id="L9"><br></p>
<p id="L10">Liese nodded and handed the candle to Ichiran, who took one of the bundles of leather paper from the shelf.<br><sup>リーゼは頷いて手燭を一良に手渡すと、棚から皮紙の束を１つ取り出した。</sup><br><sup>Liese nodded, handed him a candle, and took a bundle of leather paper from the shelf.</sup></p>
<p id="L11"><br></p>
<p id="L12">He moved to a long desk at the back of the room, transferred the fire to a candlestick near the wall, and then spread out the bark paper.<br><sup>部屋の奥の長机に移動し、壁際の燭台に火を移してから皮紙を広げる。</sup><br><sup>Move to the long desk in the back of the room, move the fire to the candlestick near the wall, and spread the paper out.</sup></p>
<p id="L13">The contents seemed to be transaction documents with the neighboring territory of Gregorn.<br><sup>内容は、隣の領地であるグレゴルン領との取引資料のようだ。</sup><br><sup>The contents seem to be transactional data with Gregorian territory.</sup></p>
<p id="L14"><br></p>
<p id="L15">"Salt import records were found at .......<br><sup>「塩の輸入記録は……あったあった」</sup><br><sup>"There was a record of salt imports..."</sup></p>
<p id="L16"><br></p>
<p id="L17">Kazuyoshi flipped through them, checking the contents and putting them together in a corner of his desk.<br><sup>一良はぱらぱらとそれらをめくり、内容を確かめて机の隅にまとめる。</sup><br><sup>Ichira flips them over, checks the contents, and puts them together in the corner of the desk.</sup></p>
<p id="L18">I'm trying to sort out what I need and bring it back to my room.<br><sup>必要なものだけを選別し、自室に持ち帰るためだ。</sup><br><sup>This is to select only the necessary items and bring them back to their rooms.</sup></p>
<p id="L19"><br></p>
<p id="L20">"Do you need diplomatic cables?<br><sup>「外交情報の資料もいる？」</sup><br><sup>"Do you have any diplomatic information?"</sup></p>
<p id="L21"><br></p>
<p id="L22">"Yes, yes. Let's put them together and bring them to my room. It's too much trouble to keep coming back for them.<br><sup>「いるいる。まとめて部屋に持っていこう。何度も取りにくるの面倒だし」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I'll take it all together to my room.It's troublesome to come and get it over and over again."</sup></p>
<p id="L23"><br></p>
<p id="L24">The two of us split up and wandered between the shelves, collecting all the materials we could find that we might need.<br><sup>２人で手分けして棚の間をうろうろと歩き、必要そうな資料を片っ端から回収する。</sup><br><sup>The two of them walk around among the shelves, collecting all the necessary materials.</sup></p>
<p id="L25">After collecting them for a while, Kazuyoshi suddenly saw a plaque that said "War Record Book.<br><sup>そうしてしばらく集めていると、ふと『戦時記録書』と書いてあるプレートが一良の目に入った。</sup><br><sup>After collecting it for a while, Ichira suddenly saw a plate with the words "War Records."</sup></p>
<p id="L26"><br></p>
<p id="L27">"War documents. ...... That's a lot of documents. Is that all of them?"<br><sup>「戦争関連の書類か……すごい量だな。これ全部そうなのか」</sup><br><sup>"War-related papers... that's a lot.Is this all the case?"</sup></p>
<p id="L28"><br></p>
<p id="L29">Muttering this, I looked at the shelves lined up in a row.<br><sup>そうつぶやきながら、ずらりと並んでいる棚を眺める。</sup><br><sup>muttered he, looking at the rows of shelves.</sup></p>
<p id="L30">There seemed to be quite a few shelves of war records, and all of the shelves were stuffed with tons of documents.<br><sup>戦時記録書の棚はかなりあるようで、棚のすべてに大量の書類が詰め込まれていた。</sup><br><sup>There seemed to be quite a few shelves of wartime records, and all the shelves were crammed with papers.</sup></p>
<p id="L31">Kazuyoshi took out one of the bundles of records from ten years ago, referring to the year written on the plate attached to it.<br><sup>一良は貼り付けてあるプレートに書かれた年号を参考に、10年前の記録書の束を１つ取り出した。</sup><br><sup>Ichira took out a bundle of records from 10 years ago, referring to the era name written on the attached plate.</sup></p>
<p id="L32"><br></p>
<p id="L33">Move to a long desk, spread them out and light them with a hand candle.<br><sup>長机に移動し、それらを広げて手燭で照らす。</sup><br><sup>Move to a long desk and spread them out and illuminate them with candles.</sup></p>
<p id="L34">The content was a chronological record of the military movements in the territory before and after the outbreak of war.<br><sup>内容は、開戦前後の領内における軍の動きを時系列順に記したものだった。</sup><br><sup>The contents were chronological records of the movements of the military in the territory before and after the war.</sup></p>
<p id="L35"><br></p>
<p id="L36">"What? On May 12th, 511th, Arcadia, under the command of General Ixios Thran, there was an attack along the river near the Barbary border. I can't read any of the military jargon. ......"<br><sup>「なになに、アルカディア歴５１１年５月12日、イクシオス・スラン将軍指揮の下、バルベール国境付近の川沿いに……ええと、ほにゃららとして……ちくしょう、軍事専門用語が全然読めねえ……」</sup><br><sup>"Why, Arcadia, May 12, 511, along the river near the Balvert border under the command of General Ixios Thran... well, I don't read any military jargon..."</sup></p>
<p id="L37"><br></p>
<p id="L38">I could read much better than before, but when the technical terms increased, I couldn't help myself.<br><sup>以前に比べればだいぶ文字が読めるようになってきたが、専門用語が増えるとお手上げ状態だった。</sup><br><sup>I've become able to read a lot more letters than before, but as the number of technical terms increased, I was at a loss.</sup></p>
<p id="L39">As Kazuyoshi groaned, a soft, gentle scent of lavender tickled his nostrils.<br><sup>一良が唸っていると、ふわっと優しいラベンダーの香りが鼻腔をくすぐった。</sup><br><sup>As Ichira groaned, the scent of lavender tickled the nasal cavity.</sup></p>
<p id="L40">When I turned my eyes in that direction, I saw Lise right next to me, peering into a document.<br><sup>その方向へ目を向けると、すぐ隣でリーゼが資料を覗き込んでいた。</sup><br><sup>I looked in that direction and saw Liese peeping into the materials right next to me.</sup></p>
<p id="L41">It was the same when she had pressed me before, but Lise's face looked even more beautiful than usual in the dim light.<br><sup>以前迫られた時もそうだったのだが、薄暗い場所で見るリーゼの顔は普段よりもさらに美しく見えた。</sup><br><sup>As before, Liese's face looked even more beautiful than usual in a dark place.</sup></p>
<p id="L42">To be honest, I was thrilled.<br><sup>正直、どきっとした。</sup><br><sup>Honestly, I was shocked.</sup></p>
<p id="L43"><br></p>
<p id="L44">"Oh, war materials. Do you want to take it with you?"<br><sup>「あ、戦時資料ね。一緒に持っていく？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, wartime materials.Do you want to bring it with you?"</sup></p>
<p id="L45"><br></p>
<p id="L46">"Well, yeah, let's just check it out.<br><sup>「そ、そうだな、一応確認しておこうか」</sup><br><sup>"Well, shall I check it out just in case?"</sup></p>
<p id="L47"><br></p>
<p id="L48">When Kazura replied in a calm manner, Lise nodded and went back to the shelf.<br><sup>平静を装いながら一良が答えると、リーゼは頷いて棚に戻っていった。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira replied pretending to be calm, Liese nodded and went back to the shelf.</sup></p>
<p id="L49">I looked away from Liese's back and looked down at the contents again.<br><sup>リーゼの背を見送り、再び内容に目を落とす。</sup><br><sup>He looks down on Liese and looks down on the content again.</sup></p>
<p id="L50">Naturally, the material is full of jargon and can only be read in a bug-eaten manner.<br><sup>当然ながら資料は専門用語だらけで、虫食い状にしか読むことができない。</sup><br><sup>Of course, the material is full of technical terms and can only be read in a worm-eaten manner.</sup></p>
<p id="L51">He struggled to decipher it for a little while, but gave up and went back to searching for materials.<br><sup>少しの間解読しようと奮闘していたが、これは駄目だと諦めて資料探しに戻るのだった。</sup><br><sup>He struggled for a while to decode it, but gave up and went back to search for materials.</sup></p>
<p id="L52"><br></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54"><br></p>
<p id="L55">They returned to Kazuyoshi's room and checked the documents.<br><sup>２人は一良の部屋に戻った後、資料の確認を行っていた。</sup><br><sup>After returning to Ichira's room, they were checking the materials.</sup></p>
<p id="L56">They sat next to each other, with Lise answering Kazuyoshi's questions.<br><sup>お互い隣り合って座り、一良の質問にリーゼが答えるかたちだ。</sup><br><sup>Sitting next to each other, Liese answers Ichira's questions.</sup></p>
<p id="L57"><br></p>
<p id="L58">"Let's take a look at the import/export section first.<br><sup>「まずは輸出入関連を見ていこうか」</sup><br><sup>"Let's look at import and export first."</sup></p>
<p id="L59"><br></p>
<p id="L60">Kazuyoshi unrolled his documents and started up his laptop and printer.<br><sup>一良は資料を広げ、ノートパソコンとプリンタを起動した。</sup><br><sup>Ichira expanded the data and started the laptop and printer.</sup></p>
<p id="L61">I scanned all the materials I brought with me and saved them as data, naming them in an easy-to-understand way.<br><sup>持ってきた資料でめぼしいものはすべてスキャンし、分かりやすく名前を付けてデータとして保存するためだ。</sup><br><sup>This is to scan any material that is outstanding, name it clearly, and save it as data.</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63">Incidentally, the other people not in the room are away on other business.<br><sup>ちなみに、部屋にいない他の面々は別の仕事で席を外している。</sup><br><sup>By the way, the other people who are not in the room are away on another job.</sup></p>
<p id="L64">Isaac is arranging the garrison for the village of Grisea. Havel is to supervise the work on the new land.<br><sup>アイザックはグリセア村の守備隊の手配。ハベルは新たな開墾地での作業の監督だ。</sup><br><sup>Isaac wanted a garrison in the village of Glyceria.Havel is the supervisor of the work in the new reclamation area.</sup></p>
<p id="L65">Narson and Zirconia are preparing for their respective visits.<br><sup>ナルソンとジルコニアは、それぞれ面会の準備中である。</sup><br><sup>Narson and Zirconia are preparing to meet, respectively.</sup></p>
<p id="L66">It seems that the military bigwigs from Kreilats will be there, and from the Isterian side, there will be some military heavyweights in attendance as well as Zirconia.<br><sup>クレイラッツからは軍のお偉いさんが来るようで、イステリア側からもジルコニアの他に武官の重鎮が何名か出席するようだ。</sup><br><sup>Clairatz seems to be coming from the army, and some important military officials in addition to zirconia from the Isteria side also seeming to attend.</sup></p>
<p id="L67"><br></p>
<p id="L68">Kazuyoshi took out his trading documents with the Gregorian territory and ran his eyes over the import records.<br><sup>一良はグレゴルン領との取引資料を取り出すと、輸入記録に目を走らせた。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira took out the transaction data with the Gregorian territory, he looked at the import records.</sup></p>
<p id="L69"><br></p>
<p id="L70">"Uh, salt, meat, dried fish, and ...... you import a lot of stuff."<br><sup>「ええと、塩と肉と魚の干物と……ずいぶん色々と輸入してるんだな」</sup><br><sup>"Well, salt, meat, dried fish... you import a lot of things."</sup></p>
<p id="L71"><br></p>
<p id="L72">"The quality of the salt is good in Gregorian territory, and the meat and hides are cheaper than in other territories, so we buy a lot. They seem to have a lot of animals, and the quality is good."<br><sup>「グレゴルン領は塩の質もいいし、肉とか皮も他領より安いから、たくさん仕入れるんだよね。動物がたくさんいるみたいで、質もいいよ」</sup><br><sup>"Gregornian territories have good salt quality, and meat and skin are cheaper than other territories, so they buy a lot.There seem to be a lot of animals, and the quality is good."</sup></p>
<p id="L73"><br></p>
<p id="L74">"I see. Lots of animals means they're putting a lot of effort into animal husbandry?"<br><sup>「そうなのか。動物がたくさんってことは、畜産に力を入れてるのかな？」</sup><br><sup>"I see. If there are a lot of animals, is it focusing on livestock?"</sup></p>
<p id="L75"><br></p>
<p id="L76">"There are a few large ranches here, but there seems to be a lot more wildlife than in the other territories. The salted wild kahuku meat is very popular. We also get salted fish, but I think we get more dried fish from Crailats.<br><sup>「そこそこ大きな牧場はいくつかあるみたいだけど、他領に比べて野生動物がかなり多いみたい。塩漬けにされた野生のカフクの肉が人気あるよ。魚の塩漬けも入ってくるけど、干物も合わせるとクレイラッツから入ってくる量のほうが多いかな」</sup><br><sup>"There seem to be some rather large ranches, but there seem to be quite a few wild animals compared to other territories.Salted wild kafuku meat is popular.Salt fish comes in, but dried fish come in more from Clairats, too."</sup></p>
<p id="L77"><br></p>
<p id="L78">According to the data, imports of salted products seem to be quite large.<br><sup>資料によると、塩漬け製品の輸入がかなり多いようだ。</sup><br><sup>According to the data, imports of salted products are quite large.</sup></p>
<p id="L79">I'm just trying to sell salt trading.<br><sup>塩取引を売りにしているだけのことはある。</sup><br><sup>I'm just selling salt.</sup></p>
<p id="L80"><br></p>
<p id="L81">"You're making a lot of salt. If it's high quality and sells well, it could be quite profitable.<br><sup>「ずいぶんと塩を作ってるんだな。高品質で高く売れるなら、かなり儲かるだろうし生産にも力を入れるか」</sup><br><sup>"You've made a lot of salt, haven't you?If you sell at a high quality and high price, you'll make a lot of money and focus on production."</sup></p>
<p id="L82"><br></p>
<p id="L83">"Not only do they deal in high quality salt, but also inferior quality salt. The high quality salt is expensive, so they often use inexpensive, low quality salt for salted products. It seems that the lower quality salt can be mass-produced more easily.<br><sup>「高品質なものばかりじゃなくて、品質の劣る塩も取引してるよ。高品質なものはやっぱり値が張るから、安価で質が低いものを塩漬け品には使ってることが多かったと思う。質の低いものの方が量産が利くみたいで」</sup><br><sup>"Not only high-quality products, but also low-quality salt.High-quality products are expensive, so I think they often use inexpensive and low-quality products as salted products.Low-quality products seem to be more effective in mass production."</sup></p>
<p id="L84"><br></p>
<p id="L85">"Well, that's that."<br><sup>「なるほど、そりゃそうか」</sup><br><sup>"I see,"</sup></p>
<p id="L86"><br></p>
<p id="L87">I nodded my head and looked at the document, then set it on the printer to scan.<br><sup>ふむふむと頷きながら資料を見ては、プリンタにセットしてスキャンを行う。</sup><br><sup>Hmmm nodding, looking at the data, and then setting it on the printer for scanning.</sup></p>
<p id="L88"><br></p>
<p id="L89">Salt, meat, fish, clothing, etc. The supplies we purchase from Gregorian territory are mostly food and daily necessities.<br><sup>塩、肉、魚、衣料品など、グレゴルン領から仕入れている物資は食料品と日用品が多い。</sup><br><sup>Supplies such as salt, meat, fish and clothing from Gregorne are mostly food and daily necessities.</sup></p>
<p id="L90">Salt, in particular, has been in stable supply for decades, and prices seem to fluctuate little.<br><sup>中でも塩は数十年もの間安定的に供給されており、価格の変動も少ないようだ。</sup><br><sup>Among them, salt has been steadily supplied for decades and prices seem to fluctuate little.</sup></p>
<p id="L91">The only major price change would be that the price has been discounted by two for the past four years.<br><sup>唯一大きな価格変動としては、４年前から２割引になっていることくらいだろう。</sup><br><sup>The only major price change is that the discount has been 20 percent since four years ago.</sup></p>
<p id="L92">There is very little trade in grain, with only rare small amounts coming and going, except for free gifts associated with immigration policies.<br><sup>穀物の取引はほとんどなく、移民政策に伴う無償提供を除けば、稀に少量が行き来しているに留まっている。</sup><br><sup>There are few grain transactions, and only a small amount of grain flows in and out of the free immigration policy.</sup></p>
<p id="L93">The main exports from the Isthmus are metals such as copper and tin, mineral resources such as marble and gypsum, and pigments.<br><sup>イステール領からの主な輸出品は、銅や錫などの金属、大理石や石膏などの鉱物資源と顔料だ。</sup><br><sup>The main exports from Istair include metals such as copper and tin, mineral resources such as marble and gypsum, and pigments.</sup></p>
<p id="L94"><br></p>
<p id="L95">"If the supply has been stable for a long time, and then suddenly the trade is reduced, is the weather really that bad?<br><sup>「ずっと安定供給されていたのに急に取引縮小ってなると、よっぽど天候が悪いのかね」</sup><br><sup>"It's been a stable supply for a long time, but if the transaction suddenly shrinks, the weather will be very bad."</sup></p>
<p id="L96"><br></p>
<p id="L97">"I don't know. I don't know what the weather will be like, but it looks like we can make it if we 'prepare ourselves', so there's nothing we can't do, right?"<br><sup>「どうだろう。天候がどうなのかはわからないけど、『身を切る覚悟』をすればなんとかできるみたいだから、やってできないことはないんじゃない？」</sup><br><sup>"I don't know what the weather is like, but if you're prepared to cut yourself, you'll be able to do something about it, so isn't there anything you can't do?"</sup></p>
<p id="L98"><br></p>
<p id="L99">"Hmmm ......, that would mean that salt production can be done regardless of weather conditions. Are they doing large scale salt production indoors?"<br><sup>「ふむ……それだと製塩は天候の関係なしに行えるってことになるな。屋内で大規模製塩でもしているのだろうか」</sup><br><sup>"Well... that means salt can be made regardless of the weather.Do they make large-scale salt indoors?"</sup></p>
<p id="L100"><br></p>
<p id="L101">"I think they have some stockpiles. If we run out of salt as soon as production stops, we won't be able to cope in case of emergency.<br><sup>「たぶんある程度備蓄があるんだと思うよ。生産が止まったらすぐに塩不足っていうんじゃ、有事の際にどうにもならないでしょ」</sup><br><sup>"Perhaps there is some stockpile.As soon as production stops, there's nothing we can do about it in case of emergency."</sup></p>
<p id="L102"><br></p>
<p id="L103">"I see."<br><sup>「なるほど」</sup><br><sup>"I see,"</sup></p>
<p id="L104"><br></p>
<p id="L105">Ichiran nodded in agreement, and Lise chuckled.<br><sup>納得したように一良が頷くと、リーゼがくすっと笑った。</sup><br><sup>When Ichira nodded convincingly, Liese giggled.</sup></p>
<p id="L106"><br></p>
<p id="L107">"What's wrong?"<br><sup>「どうかした？」</sup><br><sup>"What's the matter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L108"><br></p>
<p id="L109">"It's kind of funny that I've been the one being taught all this stuff, but today I'm the one doing the teaching.<br><sup>「何か、今までは私が色々教えてもらってたのに、今日は私が教える側になってるのがおかしくて」</sup><br><sup>"I've been taught a lot so far, but it's funny that I'm on the teacher's side today."</sup></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111">"I've been in this country for about three months now, and I know very little about the inner workings of it. ...... For a while, Lise will be my teacher and I'll be her student.<br><sup>「この国に来てから３ヶ月くらい経つけど、内情についてはほとんど知らないからなあ……しばらくは、リーゼが先生で俺が生徒だな」</sup><br><sup>"It's been about three months since I came to this country, but I know little about the inside... for a while, Liese is a teacher and I'm a student."</sup></p>
<p id="L112"><br></p>
<p id="L113">"I see. Then I'll teach you well."<br><sup>「そうなんだ。なら、しっかり教えて差し上げましょう」</sup><br><sup>"I see. Then I'll teach you well."</sup></p>
<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115">"Yes, tell me everything. Gently and carefully, if possible."<br><sup>「うん、いろいろ教えてくれ。できれば優しく丁寧に」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, tell me everything.Be kind and polite if possible."</sup></p>
<p id="L116"><br></p>
<p id="L117">"If you do well, I'll bake you some more cookies. If they're not, you can keep them."<br><sup>「よくできたら、またクッキー焼いてあげる。出来が悪かったらおあずけね」</sup><br><sup>"I'll bake you cookies again if you do well.If you don't do well, I'll leave it to you."</sup></p>
<p id="L118"><br></p>
<p id="L119">"Yeah, I'd like ...... Eira's or Marie's handiwork."<br><sup>「ええ……エイラさんかマリーさんのお手製がいいなあ」</sup><br><sup>"Yes... I wish Mr. Ayla or Mr. Marie had made it by hand."</sup></p>
<p id="L120"><br></p>
<p id="L121">"What's ......?"<br><sup>「……なんですって？」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L122"><br></p>
<p id="L123">"Oh, yes!　It was delicious!　Please do it again!"<br><sup>「うそうそ！　美味しかったです！　またお願いします！！」</sup><br><sup>"That's right! It was delicious!"Please do it again!"</sup></p>
<p id="L124"><br></p>
<p id="L125">As I went through the documents, talking lightly, the contents shifted to those of Freis territory and the royal capital.<br><sup>軽口を叩きながら資料を見ていくうちに、内容はフライス領と王都のものに移った。</sup><br><sup>While he was reading the materials, he moved on to the land of Milling and the royal capital.</sup></p>
<p id="L126">From the looks of it, the main products imported from the Freis territory are grains, fruits and fish.<br><sup>見たところ、フライス領からの輸入品は穀物や果物、魚が主なようだ。</sup><br><sup>Apparently, grain, fruit and fish are the main imports from milling territories.</sup></p>
<p id="L127">It seems that the production of mineral resources is quite low, and the Isthmus exports a large amount.<br><sup>鉱物資源の生産はかなり少ないらしく、イステール領が大量に輸出している。</sup><br><sup>Mineral resources seem to be produced very little, and the Istair region exports a lot.</sup></p>
<p id="L128">Since rivers can be used for transportation, mutual transportation costs are low.<br><sup>輸送に河川が使えるため、相互の輸送費は安く済んでいる。</sup><br><sup>Since rivers can be used for transportation, mutual transportation costs are low.</sup></p>
<p id="L129"><br></p>
<p id="L130">There are many imports of goldsmiths, foreign goods, and clothing from the royal capital.<br><sup>王都からは金細工や外来品、衣料品の輸入が多い。</sup><br><sup>Goldwork, foreign goods and clothing are imported from Wangdu.</sup></p>
<p id="L131">Other slaves are also being imported, but according to the data, some of them seem to be purchased for free.<br><sup>その他、奴隷も輸入しているようだが、資料によると一部の奴隷はタダ同然で仕入れているように見える。</sup><br><sup>Other than that, slaves seem to be importing, but according to the data, some slaves seem to be buying for nothing.</sup></p>
<p id="L132">It seems that donations are sent to the royal family on a regular basis, and this is one of the ways in which they are paid back.<br><sup>王家には献上金が定期的に送られているようなので、その見返りの１つといったところだろうか。</sup><br><sup>It seems that donations are sent regularly to the royal family, so I wonder if it's one of the rewards.</sup></p>
