<p id="L1">"In the meantime, ......, you two talk. Boy. Princess."<br><sup>「とりあえず……二人で話をしたまえ。坊や。お姫様」</sup><br><sup>"First of all... talk to me, boy.Princess,"</sup></p>
<p id="L2">"Oh, Prince ......."<br><sup>「お、王子……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, prince..."</sup></p>
<p id="L3"><br></p>
<p id="L4">The prince, who looked calm and collected, clapped his hands and told her so, smiling a little as if he pitied the princess a little under the circumstances.<br><sup>この状況下、少し姫を憐れんだように苦笑しながら、落ち着いた様子の王子が手を叩いてそう告げた。</sup><br><sup>In this situation, the prince, who looked calm, clapped his hands and said so, laughing a little pityfully at the princess.</sup></p>
<p id="L5"><br></p>
<p id="L6">"Wouldn't it be awkward and complicated if the goddesses there, and the boy's friends, were also there?"<br><sup>「そこの女神様たち、そして坊やのお友達も居たら気まずいだろうし、ややこしくなるだろう？」</sup><br><sup>"Wouldn't it be awkward and complicated to have the goddesses there and the boy's friends?"</sup></p>
<p id="L7">"Well, yeah, ......, but ......."<br><sup>「ま、あ……そうだけど……」</sup><br><sup>"Well, oh... but..."</sup></p>
<p id="L8">"This is also the duty of a boy. Go and face it properly."<br><sup>「これも男の子の務め。ちゃんと向き合ってきたまえ」</sup><br><sup>"This is the boy's duty, too.Come and face it properly."</sup></p>
<p id="L9"><br></p>
<p id="L10">I think they're especially concerned about the fact that it will be complicated for Kuron, Shinobu and Sadys.<br><sup>特にクロンとシノブとサディスはややこしくなるだろうと気を使ってくれてるのだろう。</sup><br><sup>Cron, Sinob, and Sadis, in particular, are concerned that they will get complicated.</sup></p>
<p id="L11">I nodded, thinking that it would be better to calmly unravel the difference in perception between the princess and me, since I was honestly confused about a lot of things.<br><sup>俺も正直色々と混乱しているので、姫と俺の認識の違いを冷静に紐解いた方がいいだろうと思って頷いた。</sup><br><sup>Honestly, I'm confused about a lot of things, so I nodded because I thought I should calmly unravel the difference in perception between the princess and me.</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">"...... princess ......"<br><sup>「……姫……」</sup><br><sup>"...princess..."</sup></p>
<p id="L14">"Huh?　What?"<br><sup>「ふぁ？　なーに？」</sup><br><sup>"What? What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L15">"............"<br><sup>「…………」</sup><br><sup>「…………」</sup></p>
<p id="L16">"What's wrong, Alice? Do you have a story with me?　Yes, the fiancé will talk to you.<br><sup>「どーちたの、あーす。われとおはなしあるの？　うん、フィアンセイはあーすとおはなしするよ？」</sup><br><sup>"Who are you, Earth?"Do you want to talk to me? Yes, Fiancee will talk to Earth."</sup></p>

<p id="L20">"Let's just go outside for now."<br><sup>「とりあえず、一旦外に出よう」</sup><br><sup>"Let's go out for now,"</sup></p>
<p id="L21">"Haha. We're holding hands.<br><sup>「あは。手をつないじゃったのら」</sup><br><sup>"Ah, you held hands,"</sup></p>
<p id="L22">"............"<br><sup>「…………」</sup><br><sup>「…………」</sup></p>
<p id="L23"><br></p>
<p id="L24">Pulling on the princess's hand, I went out once more.<br><sup>姫の手を引っ張って、俺はいったん外へ出る。</sup><br><sup>Pull the princess's hand and I'll go out for now.</sup></p>
<p id="L25">I don't know, maybe I'm not in the right place anymore, or maybe I'm escaping reality, or maybe I'm just crazy because I'm embarrassed about all the things that happened when I found out that she thought I liked her all along.<br><sup>もう、心ここにあらずというか、現実逃避しているというか、まあずっと俺が自分のこと好きだと思ってたと勘違いしてたのが分かって色々と恥ずかしいやらでおかしくなったのかもしれない。</sup><br><sup>I'm not here anymore, I'm running away from reality, or maybe I'm ashamed to find out that I've always thought I liked you.</sup></p>
<p id="L26">And ......<br><sup>そして……</sup><br><sup>And...</sup></p>
<p id="L27"><br></p>
<p id="L28">"Hey, Traina. ......<br><sup>『なぁ、トレイナ……』</sup><br><sup>"Well, Trina..."</sup></p>
<p id="L29">"Hmm?<br><sup>『ん？』</sup><br><sup>'Huh?'</sup></p>
<p id="L30">"That ...... is ...... no way, but ...... I know the princess is wrong about me in many ways, but... ...<br><sup>『その……よ……まさかだけど……姫が色々俺に勘違いしているのは分かったけど……』</sup><br><sup>'Well... you know... I don't think so, but...I understand that the princess misunderstands me a lot, but..."</sup></p>
<p id="L31"><br></p>
<p id="L32">To be honest, it was shocking in many ways, but it might not have gone so far if it was just a simple misunderstanding.<br><sup>正直色々と衝撃的ではあったが、単純な勘違いだけだったらここまでならないかもしれない。</sup><br><sup>Honestly, it was shocking in many ways, but if it was just a simple misunderstanding, it might not be this far.</sup></p>
<p id="L33">So, when I saw the princess' situation, a thought came to me.<br><sup>だから、俺は今の姫の状況を見て、ある考えが過った。</sup><br><sup>So when I saw the princess's situation, I thought too much.</sup></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35">"By any chance, ...... princess is ...... no way ...... me.<br><sup>『ひょっとして……姫って……まさかだけど……俺のこと……』</sup><br><sup>'By any chance...The princess... I don't think so... about me..."</sup></p>
<p id="L36">That's for him to say, not for me to answer.<br><sup>『それは本人の口から聞くべきであり、余が答えるものではない』</sup><br><sup>"You should hear it from your own mouth, not from others."</sup></p>
<p id="L37">"......, yes, but .......<br><sup>『……そうだけど……』</sup><br><sup>'...yes, but...'</sup></p>
<p id="L38">'I mean, get on with it. There's a lot of work to be done, and I don't know how much longer I can keep up this nonsense. ......<br><sup>『というか、さっさと話しを付けろ。やることが色々あるというのに、いつまでこんなくだらんことを……』</sup><br><sup>'I mean, get to the point.I have a lot of things to do, but how long will I have to do such a silly thing?"</sup></p>
<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">Traina lets out a sigh of exasperation. She already looks like she's "goofing off" with this situation.<br><sup>呆れたように溜息を吐くトレイナ。もう、この状況に「いつまでもグダグダするな」という様子。</sup><br><sup>Trina breathes out a sigh of course.It seems that the situation is no longer complaining.</sup></p>
<p id="L41">I mean, Traina doesn't seem surprised by this situation at all, did she know about it by any chance?<br><sup>つか、トレイナはこの状況に全然驚いて無さそうなんだけど、ひょっとして知ってたのか？</sup><br><sup>Trina doesn't seem surprised at all by this situation, but did she happen to know?</sup></p>
<p id="L42"><br></p>
<p id="L43">"...... princess ......"<br><sup>「……姫……」</sup><br><sup>"...princess..."</sup></p>
<p id="L44">"Huh?"<br><sup>「ふぁい？」</sup><br><sup>"Huh?"</sup></p>

<p id="L47"><br></p>
<p id="L48">We walked out of the dungeon and faced each other on the endless sky.<br><sup>地下牢から外へ出て、どこまでも続く空の上で向き合う俺たち。</sup><br><sup>We go out of the dungeon and face each other in the endless sky.</sup></p>
<p id="L49">When she heard me call her name, the princess finally became aware of the situation, scurrying around the area.<br><sup>俺に名を呼ばれて姫もようやくハッとして辺りをキョロキョロ見ながら状況に気づいた様子。</sup><br><sup>When I called her name, the princess finally noticed the situation while looking around.</sup></p>

<p id="L60">They face each other alone, but the atmosphere is awfully awkward.<br><sup>互いに二人きりで向き合うも、物凄い気まずい雰囲気だ。</sup><br><sup>Even if the two of us face each other alone, the atmosphere is very awkward.</sup></p>
<p id="L61">But I can't just keep cheating. ......<br><sup>しかしこのままズルズルするわけにもいかねーし……</sup><br><sup>But I can't just slurp like this...</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63">"It's all at ......."<br><sup>「全て……」</sup><br><sup>"Everything..."</sup></p>
<p id="L64">"What?<br><sup>「ッ！？」</sup><br><sup>"What!"</sup></p>
<p id="L65">"It's all ...... from the beginning ...... my mistake ...... is that what you mean?"<br><sup>「全て……最初から……我の勘違い……そういうことか？」</sup><br><sup>"Everything... from the beginning... my misunderstanding... is that so?"</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">My heart ached for the princess who asked so weakly.<br><sup>弱々しくそう尋ねてくる姫に胸が痛んだ。</sup><br><sup>The princess, who asked me so weakly, broke my heart.</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">"I always thought I would marry Earth in the future, and even though Earth's first love was Sadis, she was going to marry me in the future, and even though I thought she liked me during the Academy ......, it was all from the beginning... ..."<br><sup>「我はずっとアースと将来結婚すると思い、そしてアースの初恋はサディスでも、将来的には我と結婚する気で、しかもアカデミー時代は我のことを好きだと思っていた……でも、それは最初から全部……」</sup><br><sup>"I've always thought I'd marry Earth in the future, and even though Earth's first love is Sadis, he'd like to marry me in the future, and he liked me in his academy days... but it's all about it from the beginning..."</sup></p>
<p id="L70"><br></p>
<p id="L71">And by looking at this face, I know the answer to the question I asked Traina earlier.<br><sup>そしてこの顔を見れば、さっきトレイナに尋ねた問いの答えが分かる。</sup><br><sup>And by looking at this face, I can see the answer to the question I asked Trina earlier.</sup></p>
<p id="L72">I mean, that's what it was.<br><sup>つまり、そういうことだったんだ。</sup><br><sup>I mean, that's what it was.</sup></p>
<p id="L73">but ......<br><sup>にしても……</sup><br><sup>Even so...</sup></p>

<p id="L84">The tumbleweed above my eyes.<br><sup>目の上のタンコブ。</sup><br><sup>a lump in one's eye</sup></p>
<p id="L85">It was the first time since I was a child that the princess, who had always been so strong and self-respecting, had such a weak woman's face.<br><sup>いつも強くて天上天下唯我独尊って感じだった姫がこれほどか弱い女の顔をするなんて、子供の時以来かもしれない。</sup><br><sup>It may have been since she was a child that the princess, who was always strong and self-righteous, looked like such a weak woman.</sup></p>

<p id="L87">"What ...... is ...... is ...... what ...... is ......."<br><sup>「ふ……ふ、は……なんという……ことだ……」</sup><br><sup>"Hmm...hmm...hmm...what do you mean..."</sup></p>
<p id="L88">"Fiancé?"<br><sup>「フィアンセイ？」</sup><br><sup>"Fiancee?"</sup></p>
<p id="L89">"At that time, ...... I announced to the entire empire that if ...... I won, I would marry you, and if ...... you should happen to win, you would propose to me. I thought that ......

<p id="L90">"...... why?"<br><sup>「……なんでだよ」</sup><br><sup>"...why?"</sup></p>
<p id="L91"><br></p>
<p id="L92">When I was in the academy, I gritted my teeth and ...... endured humiliation ...... and tried my best ...... to beat this guy, but I never could. It was like an absolute wall that stood in the way of my path.<br><sup>アカデミー時代は何度こいつをいつか負かしてやると歯を食いしばって……屈辱に耐え……自分なりの努力をして……でも一度も勝てなくて……それは正に、俺の道の前に常に立ちはだかる絶対的な壁みたいな存在だった。</sup><br><sup>When I was at the academy, I clenched my teeth if I beat him several times... endure humiliation... make my own efforts... but I never won... it was just like an absolute wall that always stood in front of my path.</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94">"And?"<br><sup>「で？」</sup><br><sup>"And?"</sup></p>
<p id="L95">"What?"<br><sup>「？」</sup><br><sup>「？」</sup></p>
<p id="L96">"You flew out of the imperial capital ...... and in the past few months, you met that Shinobu ...... and that demon ...... called Cron, no...

<p id="L97">"...... Oh."<br><sup>「……ああ」</sup><br><sup>"...oh,"</sup></p>
<p id="L98">"After you were kidnapped by the Yamidire, Shinobu and I spent some time together, but Shinobu told me very little about you, saying that you were ...... just a memory of us. I thought Shinobu was just a woman with a headache and delusions of grandeur, because I was convinced that she had feelings for me.<br><sup>「お前がヤミディレに攫われた後、シノブとは我も一緒に過ごしたが、お前とのことは……二人の思い出だとか言って、シノブはほとんど話してはくれなかったが……どうせ、アースは我と両思いだと思い込んでいたので、シノブをただの頭の痛い妄想癖の女だと思ったものだ」</sup><br><sup>"After you were kidnapped by Yamidile, I spent time with Sinob, but Sinob told me little about you... that it was our memories, but I thought Earth was just a woman with a headache delusional habit anyway."</sup></p>
<p id="L99">"Oh~...... that's ......."<br><sup>「あ～……それは……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh... that's..."</sup></p>
<p id="L100">"That's a funny thing. The woman with the headache was me. ...... You think so, don't you?"<br><sup>「笑えるものだな。頭の痛い女は我だった……お前はそう思っているのだろう？」</sup><br><sup>"That's funny.I was the woman with a headache... you think so, don't you?"</sup></p>

<p id="L103">It's so weak.<br><sup>なんとも弱々しい。</sup><br><sup>How weak you are!</sup></p>
<p id="L104"><br></p>
<p id="L105">"So ...... you like either ...... of those two, or both ...... of them?"<br><sup>「それで……あの二人のどちらかを……それとも両方ともを……お前は好きなのか？」</sup><br><sup>"And... either of them... or both... do you like them?"</sup></p>
<p id="L106">"...... still doesn't get it.<br><sup>「……まだ、分からねえ」</sup><br><sup>"...I don't know yet."</sup></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">Sinob and Cron.<br><sup>シノブとクロンのこと。</sup><br><sup>Sinob and Cron.</sup></p>
<p id="L109">Oh, shit. I didn't expect to have this kind of conversation with the princess. ...... And ...... she gave me that look. ......<br><sup>ああ、クソ。まさか姫とこういうコイバナをすることになるとは……しかも……そんな顔をされて……</sup><br><sup>Oh, shit. I can't believe I'm going to have this kind of coybana with the princess... and... she looks like that...</sup></p>

<p id="L111">"But I'm pretty sure I don't hate you. ......"<br><sup>「でも、嫌いじゃないのは間違いない……」</sup><br><sup>"But I'm sure I don't hate it..."</sup></p>
<p id="L112">"So ...... I mean, as a ...... woman, you're aware of that?"<br><sup>「そうか……つまり……女としては、意識していると？」</sup><br><sup>"I see... I mean... as a woman, are you conscious?"</sup></p>
<p id="L113">"...... Well, ......."<br><sup>「……まぁ……な」</sup><br><sup>"...well..."</sup></p>
<p id="L114">"So, have you ever been aware of me as a ...... woman other than as a ...... childhood friend?"<br><sup>「では、我のことは……幼馴染として以外で……女として意識したことはあるか？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, have you ever been conscious of me as a woman except as a childhood friend?"</sup></p>
<p id="L115"><br></p>
<p id="L116">But I can't fool around with it here.<br><sup>だが、ここで誤魔化す訳にもいかねー。</sup><br><sup>But I don't think I can make a mistake here.</sup></p>
<p id="L117"><br></p>
<p id="L118"><br></p>

<p id="L120"><br></p>
<p id="L121">"What?<br><sup>「ッ！？」</sup><br><sup>"What!"</sup></p>
<p id="L122"><br></p>
<p id="L123"><br></p>
<p id="L124">Mistakes and misunderstandings have messed each other up and made things very messy.<br><sup>勘違いと勘違いで互いがメチャクチャに、そして物凄いメンドクサイことになっちまったんだ。</sup><br><sup>Misunderstanding and misunderstanding caused each other to mess up and become very troublesome.</sup></p>
<p id="L125">We should be clear about everything now.<br><sup>もう、全てをハッキリさせるべきだ。</sup><br><sup>Everything should be clarified now.</sup></p>
<p id="L126"><br></p>
<p id="L127">"Ha, ha ...... why couldn't I just say ...... one word ...... I love you... ...then ...... why did I take it for granted that we were both in love ......"<br><sup>「は、はは……なぜ我は……一言でも……愛していると言うことができなかったのか……そうすれば……なぜ、我らは両想いだと当たり前のように思い込んでいたのか……」</sup><br><sup>"Well... why... we... couldn't even say we loved each other... so... why did we take it for granted that we were both in love?"</sup></p>

<p id="L129">"I didn't know anything about your feelings either ...... What a ridiculous ......."<br><sup>「我もお前の気持ちを何一つ分かっていなかった……とは……何という滑稽な……」</sup><br><sup>"I didn't know anything about your feelings... what a funny thing..."</sup></p>
<p id="L130"><br></p>
<p id="L131">Even if you hurt the princess ...... fiancé, you can't ...... hurt her any more, or there's nothing you can do to mend or deceive her now.<br><sup>たとえ、姫を……フィアンセイを傷つけようと……つか、もうこれ以上傷つきようがないというか、今さら何を取り繕ったり、誤魔化しても無駄だろうしな。</sup><br><sup>For example, to hurt the princess... to hurt her fiancee... or to say that there is no way to hurt her any more, or to gloss over or deceive her now would be useless.</sup></p>
<p id="L132"><br></p>
<p id="L133">"You were unaware of me because you only had eyes for ...... Sadis?"<br><sup>「我を意識しなかったのは……サディスにしか眼中になかったからか？」</sup><br><sup>"Is it because... Sadis was the only one who was conscious of me?"</sup></p>
<p id="L134">"...... ah ......"<br><sup>「……ああ……」</sup><br><sup>"...oh..."</sup></p>
<p id="L135">"And the reason you were attracted to those two women was because you had just cooled off on Sadis?"<br><sup>「そして、あの二人の女に惹かれたのは、丁度サディスに対してお前が冷めたからか？」</sup><br><sup>"And the reason I was attracted to those two women was just because you cooled down on Sadis?"</sup></p>
<p id="L136">"...... That's not true."<br><sup>「……それは違う」</sup><br><sup>"...that's not true."</sup></p>
<p id="L137">"...... what?"<br><sup>「……なに？」</sup><br><sup>"...what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L138">"I'm sorry Fiancé, but when I was in the imperial capital, all I saw was Sadis. It's not because my feelings for Sadie have cooled down or anything like that.<br><sup>「フィアンセイには悪いが確かに帝都に居た頃の俺はサディスしか見ていなかった。でも、二人と向き合おうと思えたのは……別にサディスへの気持ちが冷めたからとかそういうことじゃねえ」</sup><br><sup>"I'm sorry for Fiancee, but when I was in the imperial capital, I only saw Sadis.But I thought I'd face them... not just because my feelings for Sadis have cooled down."</sup></p>
<p id="L139"><br></p>
