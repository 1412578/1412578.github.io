<p id="L1">We chased and chased, and when we finally found Earth, she stubbornly rejected us, running away with, of all people, Yamidire, the goddess of Kakuretail, and a handsome man who was probably of the same race as Yamidire.<br><sup>追いかけて、追いかけて、ようやく見つけたアースは俺たちを頑なに拒絶して、よりにもよってヤミディレとカクレテールの女神と、そして恐らくヤミディレと同じ種族と思われるハンサムと一緒に逃げている。</sup><br><sup>After chasing, chasing, and finally finding Earth stubbornly rejects us, and runs away with the goddess of Yamidile and Kakretail, and perhaps handsome, who are thought to be of the same race as Yamidile.</sup></p>
<p id="L2">I heard about the last decade of Yamidire in Kakrete. Some good things. And about that young man, Yosei.<br><sup>ヤミディレのこの十数年をカクレテールで聞いた。良いことも。そしてあのヨーセイっていう若者のことも。</sup><br><sup>I heard about the past decade or so of Yamidile in Cacletail.Good things, and that young man named Yosei.</sup></p>

<p id="L5">Is Earth being deceived? Is it not?<br><sup>アースが騙されているのか。そうではないのか。</sup><br><sup>Is Earth being deceived?Isn't that the case?</sup></p>
<p id="L6">What does that have to do with the fact that Earth was able to use the techniques of the Great Demon Lord Traina?<br><sup>そこに、アースが大魔王トレイナの技を使えたことと何か関係あるのか？</sup><br><sup>Is there anything to do with Earth's ability to use Trina's skills?</sup></p>

<p id="L8">That's why I went after that guy.<br><sup>だからこそ、あいつを追いかけた。</sup><br><sup>That's why I chased him.</sup></p>
<p id="L9">I want to know the truth.<br><sup>真実を知りたい。</sup><br><sup>I want to know the truth.</sup></p>

<p id="L17">She's not going to tell us anything. That one word, filled with such a feeling, gutted Ma'am and me.<br><sup>俺たちには何も話さない。そんな気持ちの込められたその一言が、俺とマアムを抉った。</sup><br><sup>He won't tell us anything.That word with that feeling dug me and Maam.</sup></p>
<p id="L18">And neither I nor Ma'am could argue with anything.<br><sup>そして俺もマアムも何も反論できなかった。</sup><br><sup>And neither I nor Maam could refute anything.</sup></p>
<p id="L19">Since that game, we have been confronted with the fact that we don't know what we don't know. We were confronted with our own stupidity, "We don't know what we don't know, and we don't know what we don't know.<br><sup>あの御前試合の時から、「何も分かっていない。何が分かっていないかも分かっていない」という自分たちのマヌケぶりを突き付けられた。</sup><br><sup>"I don't know anything from that game.I don't even know what I don't know," they said.</sup></p>

<p id="L26">That was the only way I could tell that Earth loved this girl.<br><sup>それだけで、アースがこの子を可愛がってたんだなってことが分かった。</sup><br><sup>That alone showed that Earth loved her.</sup></p>
<p id="L27">I never thought we'd be jealous of this little guy. ......<br><sup>まさか、俺たちがこんなチビッ子に嫉妬しちまうだなんてな……</sup><br><sup>I can't believe we're jealous of such a little boy...</sup></p>
<p id="L28"><br></p>
<p id="L29">Then something unexpected happened.<br><sup>すると、意外なことが起こった。</sup><br><sup>Then something unexpected happened.</sup></p>
<p id="L30"><br></p>
<p id="L31">That goddess girl is turning around and saying something. Then Earth also stops, turns around, and has a smile on her mouth.<br><sup>あの女神の娘が振り返って何かを言ってる。するとアースも止まり、振り返り、そしてその口元に笑みを浮かべている。</sup><br><sup>The goddess's daughter turned around and said something.Then Earth stopped, looked back, and smiled at his mouth.</sup></p>
<p id="L32"><br></p>
<p id="L33">What are you up to?<br><sup>何かを企んでいる？</sup><br><sup>Are you up to something?</sup></p>
<p id="L34"><br></p>
<p id="L35">However, Yamidire was the only one who seemed to be subtle about it.<br><sup>しかし、ヤミディレだけは微妙そうな顔をしている。</sup><br><sup>However, only the blackout looks subtle.</sup></p>
<p id="L36"><br></p>
<p id="L37">Yes, I had thought that Yamidire was in control of that group.<br><sup>そう、俺はてっきりあのメンツの主導権はヤミディレが握っていると思っていた。</sup><br><sup>Yes, I definitely thought that Yamidile was in charge of that face.</sup></p>
<p id="L38">But don't you?<br><sup>でも、そうじゃない？</sup><br><sup>But isn't it?</sup></p>
<p id="L39"><br></p>
<p id="L40">Then, Earth and the others landed on a remote island that came into view.<br><sup>そして、アースたちは視界に入った離れ小島に降りた。</sup><br><sup>Then the Earths descended to a remote island in sight.</sup></p>
<p id="L41">It was as if it was trying to intercept us.<br><sup>それは、俺たちを迎え撃とうとしているかのように。</sup><br><sup>It's like they're trying to pick us up.</sup></p>
<p id="L42"><br></p>
<p id="L43">Earth.<br><sup>アース。</sup><br><sup>Earth.</sup></p>

<p id="L50">Ma'am and I felt a sense of tension as we wondered if they were going to fight us.<br><sup>まさかこのまま俺たちと戦おうというのかと、俺とマアムにも緊張感が走った。</sup><br><sup>Maam and I were nervous about whether they would fight us like this.</sup></p>
<p id="L51">Yamidire is here.<br><sup>ヤミディレが居るんだ。</sup><br><sup>There's a blackout.</sup></p>
<p id="L52">I had expected such a development.<br><sup>そういう展開だって予想はしていた。</sup><br><sup>I expected that to happen.</sup></p>
<p id="L53"><br></p>
<p id="L54">However, the sight of my own son facing us alongside Yamidire gave me an indescribable pain in my chest.<br><sup>とはいえ、自分の息子がヤミディレと並んで俺たちと向き合っている光景には、何とも言えない胸の痛みが出ちまった。</sup><br><sup>However, the sight of my son facing us side by side with Yamidile gave me indescribable chest pain.</sup></p>
<p id="L55"><br></p>
<p id="L56">But for those of us who are so tense, ......<br><sup>しかし、そんな緊迫した俺らに対して……</sup><br><sup>But to us who are so tense...</sup></p>

<p id="L64">No, it's impossible for me and Ma'am not to be surprised.<br><sup>いや、そりゃ俺もマアムも驚くなって方が無理だ。</sup><br><sup>No, it's impossible for me and Maam not to be surprised.</sup></p>
<p id="L65">I had heard from some of Earth's friends beforehand that Earth would marry the goddess of Kakretele after winning the tournament, but I never thought I would hear her say it out loud here, and with Yamidire as well.<br><sup>事前にアースの友達だって奴らから、大会で優勝したアースがカクレテールの女神様と結婚するって話は聞いていたが、ここでそれを本人と、しかもヤミディレまで一緒になって大声で言われるとは思わなかった。</sup><br><sup>I've heard from Earth's friends beforehand that Earth, who won the tournament, is going to marry the goddess of Kakretale, but I didn't expect to be told this loudly with him and even Yamidire.</sup></p>
<p id="L66"><br></p>
<p id="L67">--I'll make your flower garden bloom in full bloom!<br><sup>――満開の花畑を咲かせてみせよう！</sup><br><sup>I'll show you a field of flowers in full bloom!</sup></p>
<p id="L68"><br></p>
<p id="L69">As if to confuse us even more, that handsome man turned the entire area around our feet into a field of flowers with his magic.<br><sup>そんな驚く俺たちを更に混乱させるかのように、あのイケメンが魔法で足元辺り一面を花畑に変えやがった。</sup><br><sup>As if to confuse us even more, that handsome man magically turned everything around his feet into a flower garden.</sup></p>
<p id="L70">Because I don't feel any threat or trickery from those flowers, I don't even know what's going on or what they mean.<br><sup>その花に、何の脅威も仕掛けも感じないからこそ、何が起こって、何の意味があるのかも分からない。</sup><br><sup>I don't know what's going on or what's going on because I don't feel any threat or device in the flower.</sup></p>
<p id="L71">If this were a war, I would have just blown it off with a bang, but that wasn't the case, and Ma'am and I were just confused.<br><sup>これが戦争だったら、とりあえずドカーンとふっとばしてるが、そういうわけにもいかず、俺もマアムもただ戸惑うだけ。</sup><br><sup>If this were a war, I'd be flustered for now, but that's not the case, and I and Maam just get confused.</sup></p>
<p id="L72">And for those of us who do, ......<br><sup>そして、そんな俺たちに対して……</sup><br><sup>And against us...</sup></p>

<p id="L78">Earth was running towards us.<br><sup>アースが俺たちに向かって走ってきた。</sup><br><sup>Earth came running toward us.</sup></p>
<p id="L79">I don't feel any sign of an attack, kill or hostility.<br><sup>攻撃の気配も、殺気も敵意も感じない。</sup><br><sup>There is no sign of attack, no murder or hostility.</sup></p>
<p id="L80">But his eyes were aiming at something. I felt a strong will.<br><sup>だけど、その眼は何かを狙っていた。強い意志を感じた。</sup><br><sup>But his eyes were after something.I felt a strong will.</sup></p>
<p id="L81">And ......<br><sup>そして……</sup><br><sup>And...</sup></p>

<p id="L87">Ma'am and I saw it. No, we were shown.<br><sup>俺とマアムは見た。いや、見せつけられた。</sup><br><sup>Maam and I saw it.No, I was shown.</sup></p>
<p id="L88">The realm that Earth has now reached.<br><sup>今のアースが到達した領域を。</sup><br><sup>The area where the current earth has reached.</sup></p>
<p id="L89"><br></p>
<p id="L90">At Kakretele, I heard that Earth had won a tournament and even fought Yamidire and won.<br><sup>カクレテールで、アースが大会で優勝し、更にはヤミディレと戦って勝ったという話を聞いた。</sup><br><sup>At Cacletale, I heard that Earth won the tournament and even beat Yamidile.</sup></p>
<p id="L91">However, both Ma'am and I thought it was "impossible" and assumed that he must have used some kind of trick.<br><sup>しかし、俺もマアムもそれは「ありえない」と思い、何かの策を使ったのだろうと決めつけていた。</sup><br><sup>However, both Maam and I thought it was "impossible" and decided that they had used some kind of course.</sup></p>
<p id="L92">In a way, we knew more about Yamidire's power than we did about Earth's power.<br><sup>ある意味で、俺たちはアースの力よりも、ヤミディレの力のことをよく知っていたからだ。</sup><br><sup>for in a sense we knew more about the power of the Yamidile than of the power of the Earth.</sup></p>
<p id="L93">But he also knew that Yamidire was not an opponent that could be defeated by "strategy alone".<br><sup>だけど、ヤミディレが「策だけ」で勝てる相手ではないということもよく分かっていた。</sup><br><sup>However, I knew well that Yamidile was not the only opponent who could win by "measures."</sup></p>
<p id="L94">So I thought Earth must be stronger than we think .......<br><sup>だから、アースも俺たちが思っているよりも強くなっているのだろう……と思っていた。</sup><br><sup>That's why I thought Earth was stronger than we thought...</sup></p>
<p id="L95">We should have thought so, and yet we didn't expect him to have reached this point.<br><sup>そう思っていたはずなのに、それでも俺たちはあいつがここまで達しているということをまるで予期していなかった。</sup><br><sup>I'm sure you thought so, but we never expected him to have come this far.</sup></p>
<p id="L96">I didn't understand.<br><sup>分かっていなかった。</sup><br><sup>I didn't understand.</sup></p>

<p id="L102">I don't know the principle or logic behind it, but I just said, "Well, it's like this, right?

<p id="L103">I don't usually understand such principles and theories, but I do understand this one.<br><sup>そんな原理や理屈が普段はあまり分からねー俺でも、これだけは分かる。</sup><br><sup>I don't usually understand such principles and logic.Even I understand this.</sup></p>

<p id="L114">Earth's current steps are not just the result of practicing techniques.<br><sup>今のアースのステップは、ただ技を練習したとかそういう次元じゃねぇ。</sup><br><sup>The current Earth step is not just a dimension of practicing techniques.</sup></p>
<p id="L115"><br></p>
<p id="L116">A bloody effort. I could see that they had practiced over and over again, running and running and running, and had mastered their movements so brilliantly and powerfully that I couldn't help but admire them.<br><sup>血の滲むような努力。走って走って走りまくって、何度も何度も反復練習して身に着けたと分かるほど、思わず見とれちまうぐらいの華麗で力強い動きだった。</sup><br><sup>It was a bloody effort.It was such a gorgeous and powerful move that I could not help but admire it that I could tell that I had worn it by running and running around and practicing over and over again.</sup></p>

<p id="L118">Yes, I regretted it all the time, even when I ran out of the Imperial City after the game.<br><sup>そうだ、御前試合の後、あいつを追いかけて俺も帝都から飛び出した時にもそのことをずっと俺は後悔していた。</sup><br><sup>Yes, I regretted it all the time when I ran out of the imperial capital after the game.</sup></p>
