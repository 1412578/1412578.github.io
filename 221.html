<p id="L33">I wondered what would happen when I heard that Yamidire had taken Earth, but it seems that things aren't particularly bad here, but rather that he's making an effort with his friends and is well-liked by many people.<br><sup>ヤミディレがアースを連れ去ったと聞いたときはどうなるかと思ったが、ここでは特に酷いことにはならず、むしろ友達と努力したり、多くの人たちからも慕われているみたいだな。</sup><br><sup>I wondered what would happen when I heard that Yamidile had taken Earth away, but it wasn't particularly bad here, and rather it seemed that he was trying with his friends and loved by many people.</sup></p>
<p id="L34">I didn't know that I even had a sister before I knew it.<br><sup>つか、いつの間にか妹分までできていたとはな。</sup><br><sup>I can't believe I even had a sister before I knew it.</sup></p>
<p id="L35">I thought that guy was still an immature kid that I, Ma'am, and Sadis had to watch over.<br><sup>あいつには、俺やマアムが、そしてサディスが見てやらなくちゃいけない、まだまだ未熟な子供だと思っていたんだけどな。</sup><br><sup>I thought he was still an immature child who I, Maam, and Sadis had to look at.</sup></p>

<p id="L37">So I didn't notice, didn't know, didn't understand anything important.<br><sup>だから大事なことを何も気づかず、知らず、分からずじまいだったんだ。</sup><br><sup>So I didn't realize anything important, didn't know anything, didn't know anything.</sup></p>

<p id="L40"><br></p>
<p id="L41">On the grounds of the church where Arth had been staying for a while, I heard from his friends about what he had been up to, and with many mixed feelings, I smiled and muttered to myself at the only statue intact in the church, the one called "God.<br><sup>アースがしばらく居候していたという教会の敷地で俺は、アースの友からこれまでのことを聞き、色々と複雑な気分になりながら、教会で唯一無傷で残っている、「神様」と呼ばれている銅像に苦笑しながら呟いた。</sup><br><sup>On the grounds of the church where Earth had stayed for a while, I heard from a friend of Earth's and muttered bitterly at the only statue left intact in the church, called "God."</sup></p>
<p id="L42">There, although somewhat "heaped up," the face was definitely that of our former nemesis.<br><sup>そこには、多少「盛られ」ているものの、その顔は間違いなく、かつての俺たちの宿敵のもの。</sup><br><sup>It's a little "filled" there, but it's definitely the face of our old enemy.</sup></p>

<p id="L44">"Earth used your power and made a fuss about it ......, and Earth was disappointed and repulsed by us, and then we arrived at this place ...... haha... ...I don't know what's going on."<br><sup>「アースがお前の力を使い、そのことで騒ぎになって……で、アースが俺たちに失望し、反発し、そしてたどり着いたこの地は……ははは……どーなってんだかな」</sup><br><sup>"Earth used your power to make a fuss about it... and Earth was disappointed in us, rebelled against us, and arrived here... hahaha... what's going on?"</sup></p>

<p id="L46">Kakretele is not a member of the Union, and is a closed country with no information.<br><sup>カクレテールは連合加盟国ではなく、情報も閉ざされた鎖国国家。</sup><br><sup>Cacletair is not a member of the Union, but a closed-door country with closed information.</sup></p>
<p id="L47">However, during the war, there was a suspicion of a connection with the Demon King's army, so there was a certain amount of monitoring, but in the end, nothing related to Kakretele appeared on the stage during the war, and the war ended as it was, as if nothing had happened.<br><sup>とはいえ、戦時中は魔王軍との繋がりの疑いも無きにしも非ずということで、それなりに監視はされていたが、結局戦争でもカクレテールに関連するものが表舞台に出ることは無く、そのまま戦争も終わり、何事もなかったかのようにそのままだった。</sup><br><sup>However, during the war, there was no doubt that there was no connection with the demon king's army, so it was monitored in its own way, but in the end, nothing related to Kakretail appeared on the stage, and the war ended as if nothing had happened.</sup></p>

<p id="L54">"Hmm?　Ohhh, no. ......"<br><sup>「ん？　あ～、いや……」</sup><br><sup>"Huh? Oh, no..."</sup></p>
<p id="L55"><br></p>
<p id="L56"><br></p>
<p id="L57">Traina. What the hell have you and the Demon Lord's army done with Earth?<br><sup>トレイナ。お前ら魔王軍は一体、アースをどうしたんだ？</sup><br><sup>Trina, what the hell did you guys do with Earth?</sup></p>
<p id="L58">Yamidire. You're the first person in over a decade to come out into the open, and what do you want with Earth?<br><sup>ヤミディレ。お前は十数年ぶりに表に出て来たと思ったら、アースをどうしたいんだ？</sup><br><sup>Yamidile. What do you want to do with Earth if you think it's been more than a decade?</sup></p>
<p id="L59">I don't know why Earth was able to use Traina's technique. The suspicion that Earth might be connected to the remnants of the Demon King's army has yet to be cleared up in the Imperial Capital.<br><sup>どうしてアースがトレイナの技を使えたのかは分からない。アースが魔王軍の残党と繋がりがあるのではないかという疑いもまだ帝都では晴れていない。</sup><br><sup>I don't know how Earth could use Trina's technique.Suspicions that Earth may be related to the remnants of the demon army have not yet been cleared up in the imperial capital.</sup></p>
<p id="L60">But this is not the way to go ......<br><sup>でも、これじゃぁ……</sup><br><sup>But this is...</sup></p>
<p id="L61"><br></p>
<p id="L62">"So those earthlings are now on that cloud in the sky?<br><sup>「で、そのアースたちは今、あの空の雲の上に居るわけか」</sup><br><sup>"And those earths are now above the clouds in the sky?"</sup></p>

<p id="L66">Well, I guess you could say that the Yamidire were that kind of race.<br><sup>まぁ、ヤミディレはそういう種族と言えばそうだったかもしれねーけど。</sup><br><sup>Well, that might have been the case with the Yamidile.</sup></p>
<p id="L67">I'm not sure what to do, but I'm going to join forces with my human friends to rescue Yamidire,...... or .......

<p id="L70"><br></p>
<p id="L71">"Those sky people are cowards. ...... They attacked us when the High Priestess was in a state of tatters after losing a fight with Earth. ......

<p id="L78">Yeah, that's it, that's what I thought the most, "Seriously?<br><sup>そう、それだよ、一番「マジかよ」って思ったのは。</sup><br><sup>Yes, that's what I thought the most.</sup></p>
<p id="L79">Is it true that Earth got into a fight with Yamidire and won? ......<br><sup>アースが、ヤミディレと喧嘩して勝ったって……本当かぁ？</sup><br><sup>Earth won a fight with Yamidile... Really?</sup></p>
<p id="L80">Even though it has been more than a decade since the last war, I know the strength of the Six Supremes better than anyone else.<br><sup>たとえ、かつての戦争から十数年経っていようとも、六覇大魔将の強さは俺が一番よく知っている。</sup><br><sup>Even if it's been more than a decade since the war, I know the strength of the Six Hegemons best.</sup></p>

<p id="L83">Hakki has tried to kill me many times.<br><sup>ハクキには何度も殺されかけた。</sup><br><sup>Hakuki almost killed me many times.</sup></p>
<p id="L84">Everything about Gouda was just so big.<br><sup>ゴウダは何もかもがとにかくデカかった。</sup><br><sup>Goda was big in everything anyway.</sup></p>
<p id="L85">Leifant was a proud man, even though he was an enemy.<br><sup>ライファントは敵ながら誇り高い奴だった。</sup><br><sup>Reifant was an enemy but proud fellow.</sup></p>
<p id="L86">Yamidire was a disaster and scary.<br><sup>ヤミディレは禍々しくて怖かった。</sup><br><sup>The yamidire was evil and scary.</sup></p>

<p id="L90">Despite the differences in strength and fighting styles, all six of them were still strong and dangerous.<br><sup>力の差や、戦闘スタイルに違いはあれど、それでも六人全員強く、そしてヤバかった。</sup><br><sup>Despite the differences in strength and fighting style, all six of them were strong and crazy.</sup></p>
<p id="L91">Earth had also become much stronger than Ma'am and I had imagined, as far as the Gozenkai was concerned.<br><sup>アースも御前試合を見る限り、俺とマアムの想像を遥かに上回るほど強くなっていた。</sup><br><sup>As far as you can see, Earth was much stronger than Maam and I imagined.</sup></p>
<p id="L92">But the power of three months ago was still not enough to fight against the Six Supremes.<br><sup>だけど、三カ月前の力では、まだ六覇と戦うには力不足だった。</sup><br><sup>But three months ago, he was still not strong enough to fight against the six hegemony.</sup></p>
<p id="L93">And yet, you won?　Even if he did have a plan, the Sixth Heaven is not so naive that it can be managed by a plan alone.<br><sup>それなのに、勝った？　仮に何か策を弄したのだとしても、策だけでどうにかできるほど六覇は甘くねえ。</sup><br><sup>But did you win?Even if you play with some strategy, the six hegemony is not so sweet that you can manage it with just a strategy.</sup></p>
<p id="L94">This means that Earth is now strong enough to fight the Six Supremes.<br><sup>つまり、今のアースは六覇と戦えるレベルまで強くなっているってことだ。</sup><br><sup>In other words, Earth is strong enough to fight against the six hegemony.</sup></p>
<p id="L95"><br></p>

<p id="L100">"What's wrong with ......?"<br><sup>「ん……どうしたの？」</sup><br><sup>"Well... what's the matter?"</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">While patting me on the head, Earth's sister peeked out at me.<br><sup>そんな頭を抱える俺をポンポンと叩きながら、アースの妹分が俺を覗き込んできた。</sup><br><sup>Earth's younger sister peeped into me as she patted me with such a head.</sup></p>
<p id="L103">I guess I had enough on my face to make this girl worry about me.<br><sup>こんな子にまで心配されるぐらい、俺は顔に出てたみてーだな。</sup><br><sup>I was so worried that even such a child appeared on my face.</sup></p>
<p id="L104"><br></p>

<p id="L107">"What?<br><sup>「え？」</sup><br><sup>"What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L108"><br></p>
<p id="L109">In any case, even if it's true that we're going to the sky world right now, to be honest, neither Ma'am nor I can use flight magic, so we have no way to get there at this point.<br><sup>いずれにせよ、今、天空世界に行っているというのが本当だとしても、正直俺もマアムも飛行の魔法を使うことは出来ないので、今の時点ではあそこまで行く手段がねえ。</sup><br><sup>Anyway, even if it's true that you're in the sky right now, honestly, neither I nor Maam can use the magic of flight, so there's no way to get there at this point.</sup></p>

<p id="L114">I huffed at the words of an innocent child who confidently believed ......, no matter how far he went.<br><sup>自信満々に……いや、どこまでも信じきった純真無垢な子供の言葉に、俺はハッとした。</sup><br><sup>Confidently... No, I was surprised by the innocent child's words that I believed forever.</sup></p>

<p id="L120">Oh ...... well ...... I don't know or understand "current earth" any better than this girl ......<br><sup>ああ……そうか……俺は「今のアース」をこの子よりも知らないし、分かってないんだ……</sup><br><sup>Oh... I see... I don't know or understand "the earth now" more than she does...</sup></p>
<p id="L121"><br></p>
<p id="L122">"Nee-chan, Amae won when I cheered for her, so it's okay!　It's Shoko!"<br><sup>「おにーちゃん、アマエが応援したら優勝したし、だから大丈夫！　これ、しょーこだもん！」</sup><br><sup>"Hey, if Amae cheered for me, I won the championship, so it's okay! This is Shoko!"</sup></p>
<p id="L123">"Hmm?　...... Noooo, that's it!"<br><sup>「ん？　……ぬおっ、そ、それは！」</sup><br><sup>"Huh? ... oh, oh, that's it!"</sup></p>
<p id="L124">"I won this, big guy!"<br><sup>「これ、おにーちゃん優勝したの！」</sup><br><sup>"This is my brother's victory!"</sup></p>
<p id="L125"><br></p>
<p id="L126">Then, trotting off, Amae pulled something out of the rubble and pointed it at me with a guffaw.<br><sup>そう言って、トコトコと駆け出して、アマエは瓦礫の中から何かを取り出して、それを俺にグイッと向けてきた。</sup><br><sup>Then he ran out, and Amae took something out of the rubble and pointed it at me.</sup></p>
<p id="L127">And I was shocked again when I saw it.<br><sup>そして、俺はそれを見て再び衝撃を覚えた。</sup><br><sup>And when I saw it, I was shocked again.</sup></p>
<p id="L128"><br></p>
<p id="L129">"This is a ...... trophy. ...... is a trophy. ...... is a trophy. ...... is a trophy. ...... is a trophy. Earth received ...... this as a trophy. ......"<br><sup>「こ、これは……ゆ、優勝トロフィーか……は、はは、誰がデザインしたかはすぐに分かるが……こ、これをアースが優勝トロフィーとして受け取っ……たと……」</sup><br><sup>"This is... Yu, the championship trophy... haha, I can tell right away who designed it, but... Earth received this as the championship trophy..."</sup></p>
<p id="L130"><br></p>
<p id="L131">If no one else had been here, I might have been slumped over the medal my son had won.<br><sup>もし、この場に誰も居なければ、俺は自分の息子が手にした勲章を見て、のたうち回っていたかもしれない。</sup><br><sup>If there was no one here, I might have stumbled around looking at the medals my son had received.</sup></p>
<p id="L132">How hateful.<br><sup>何とも憎々しい。</sup><br><sup>What a hateful thing is!</sup></p>
<p id="L133">It is a golden statue of the Great Demon King Traina with wings growing from his back, his left hand on his waist, his right foot on a square platform, his right index finger sticking out toward the sky, and a crown on his head.<br><sup>金ぴかに輝く大魔王トレイナが背中から翼を生やし、腰に左手を置いて、右足を四角い台の上に乗せ、右の人差し指を天に向かって突き出して、さらにその頭には王冠をしている像だ。</sup><br><sup>Trina, the golden demon king, has wings from her back, her left hand on her waist, her right foot on a square table, her right index finger protruding toward the sky, and her head is covered with a crown.</sup></p>
<p id="L134"><br></p>
<p id="L135">"Ha, ha ...... ha ......."<br><sup>「は、はは……はぁ……」</sup><br><sup>"Well... well..."</sup></p>
<p id="L136"><br></p>
<p id="L137">I'm already laughing in disgust.<br><sup>もう、呆れて笑ってしまう。</sup><br><sup>I can't help laughing.</sup></p>
<p id="L138">Huh?　Traina. You watching this in hell?<br><sup>なぁ？　トレイナ。地獄で見てるか？</sup><br><sup>Hey, Trina.Are you watching me in hell?</sup></p>
<p id="L139">If this is your revenge against me, there's no better revenge than this.<br><sup>もしこれが、お前の俺に対する復讐なのだとしたら、これ以上の復讐はねえよ。</sup><br><sup>If this is your revenge against me, I can't get any more revenge.</sup></p>
<p id="L140"><br></p>
<p id="L141">"Hiiro, I've managed to calm down."<br><sup>「ヒイロ～、こっちは何とか落ち着いたわよ」</sup><br><sup>"Hiro~ I've managed to calm down here,"</sup></p>
<p id="L142">"Oh?　Right."<br><sup>「お？　そうか」</sup><br><sup>"Oh? I see,"</sup></p>
<p id="L143">"Yeah. What's ......, that gilded thing?　...... and Traina?"<br><sup>「うん。……って、何よその金ぴかの！　……と、トレイナ？」</sup><br><sup>"Yes. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."</sup></p>
<p id="L144">"Hahaha ...... looks like a medal for our dear son, huh?"<br><sup>「ははは……俺たちの愛する息子の勲章みたいだぜ？」</sup><br><sup>"Haha... it's like our beloved son's medal, isn't it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L145">"What about ......?"<br><sup>「は……はぁ？」</sup><br><sup>"What... what?"</sup></p>
<p id="L146"><br></p>
<p id="L147">At that moment, Ma'am came running up to me as I was smiling at the Traina trophy.<br><sup>そのとき、トレイナトロフィーに苦笑している俺の所へ、マアムが駆け寄ってきた。</sup><br><sup>Then Maam came running to me smiling bitterly at Trainatrophy.</sup></p>
<p id="L148">As I suspected, Ma'am was surprised by the Traina trophy, too.<br><sup>案の定、マアムもトレイナトロフィーに驚いたようだな。</sup><br><sup>As expected, Maam seems surprised by Trainatrophy.</sup></p>
<p id="L149"><br></p>
<p id="L150">"So, how did it go?　That young guy, Yosei?<br><sup>「で、どうだった？　あのヨーセイとかって若いのは」</sup><br><sup>"And how was it?"That young Yosei is,"</sup></p>
<p id="L151">"What?　Oh, yeah. He's got some pretty severe damage to his pits, nerves, and muscles all over his body. The side effects of the drug almost crippled me."<br><sup>「え？　あ、うん。かなり重度に全身の魔穴や神経、筋肉を傷めているわ。薬物の副作用で、ほとんど廃人寸前だったわ」</sup><br><sup>"What? Oh, yeah. I'm seriously damaging all my magical holes, nerves and muscles.The side effects of the drug were almost scrapped."</sup></p>
<p id="L152">"I see. At ......?<br><sup>「そっか……で？」</sup><br><sup>"Really... so?"</sup></p>
<p id="L153">"Yes. I did some treatment on my end and got him to vomit up the drugs that were still in his system. But ......"<br><sup>「うん。一応私の方である程度の治療はしておいて、体内に残っていた薬も吐き出させたわ。でも……」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, I treated him to some extent, and I let him spit out the medicine that was left in his body.But..."</sup></p>
<p id="L154">"It's hard to make a full recovery. ......?"<br><sup>「完治は難しい……か？」</sup><br><sup>"Is it difficult to cure completely..."</sup></p>
<p id="L155">"Maybe. From now on, if you rest, you'll be able to recover enough to go about your daily life, but you won't be able to do ...... anything like a wizard or a warrior anymore."<br><sup>「多分ね。今後、安静にしていれば日常生活を送るぐらいには回復できるだろうけど……魔法使いや戦士みたいなことはもう……」</sup><br><sup>"Maybe. If I rest in the future, I'll be able to recover enough to live my daily life... but I'm not going to be like a wizard or a warrior anymore..."</sup></p>
<p id="L156"><br></p>
<p id="L157">As we stepped into the country and the devastation reminded me of the wars of the past, I found a young man being nursed back to health by a group of girls.<br><sup>俺たちがこの国に足を踏み入れて、その惨状を見てかつての戦争を思い出して心が苦しくなっていた中で、女の子たちに看病されている一人の若者を見つけた。</sup><br><sup>As we set foot in this country and saw the tragedy, we found a young man who was cared for by the girls in the midst of the agony of remembering the war.</sup></p>
<p id="L158">The young man, who could hardly have been older than Arth, was in considerable danger.<br><sup>アースとほとんど年齢も変わらないだろうその若者はかなり危険な状態だった。</sup><br><sup>The young man, who was almost the same age as Earth, was in a pretty dangerous situation.</sup></p>
<p id="L159"><br></p>
<p id="L160">"I guess that's also the work of ...... Yami Dire, ...... damn ......."<br><sup>「それもまた……ヤミディレの仕業なんだろうな……ったく……」</sup><br><sup>"That's also... the work of Yamidile, isn't it?"</sup></p>
<p id="L161"><br></p>
<p id="L162">Not only about Earth, but also about the current Yamidire, as taught to me by Motoriage and others.<br><sup>アースのことだけでなく、モトリアージュたちから教えてもらった、今のヤミディレのこと。</sup><br><sup>Not only about Earth, but also about the current Yamidire that Motriage taught me.</sup></p>
<p id="L163">The story goes that the people of this country love him so much that they are willing to risk their lives to save him.<br><sup>この国の民たちからは、それこそ命懸けで助けに行こうと想われるほどに慕われているという話。</sup><br><sup>It is said that the people of this country love it so much that they want to risk their lives to help them.</sup></p>
<p id="L164">But on the other hand, behind the scenes, they're still trying to kill young people who are not much older than Earth ......, and that's not something I can tolerate. ......<br><sup>だが一方で、その裏ではまだアースと大して変わらない年代の若者を……そうなると、やはり許せる存在じゃねえ……</sup><br><sup>But on the other hand, behind the scenes, young people of the same age as Earth... then I can't forgive them...</sup></p>
<p id="L165"><br></p>
<p id="L166">"Yes. And ......."<br><sup>「そうね。あと……」</sup><br><sup>"Yes, and..."</sup></p>
<p id="L167">"Hmm?"<br><sup>「ん？」</sup><br><sup>"Huh?"</sup></p>
<p id="L168">"That drug ...... I can't tell you without analyzing it in detail, but ...... it was a little like what that Sixth Supreme's lowest demon used to try to spread, or... ..."<br><sup>「その薬物……詳しく分析しないと分からないけど……あの六覇の最低悪魔がかつて蔓延させようとしていたものと少し似ていたというか……」</sup><br><sup>"The drug... I don't know until I analyze it in detail... it was a little similar to what those six worst demons were trying to spread..."</sup></p>
<p id="L169">"Parisi. ...... Well, let's not talk about that guy. ...... He's already dead.<br><sup>「パリピか……ま、あいつのことはいいとして……もう死んだ奴だし」</sup><br><sup>"Paripi... well, if you don't mind him... he's already dead."</sup></p>
<p id="L170">"Yeah, I know. I get goose bumps just hearing the name. Anyway, it's such a lousy drug."<br><sup>「そ、そうね。私も名前を聞いただけでも鳥肌立つわ。とにかく、そんな最低の薬物ってことよ」</sup><br><sup>"Well, that's right. I get goosebumps just by hearing your name. Anyway, that's the worst drug."</sup></p>
<p id="L171"><br></p>
<p id="L172">I know exactly how Ma'am feels when she looks uncomfortable just remembering.<br><sup>思い出すだけでも嫌そうな顔をするマアムの気持ちは俺もよく分かる。</sup><br><sup>I understand Maam's feelings very well, who looks disgusted just by remembering.</sup></p>
<p id="L173">And Yamidire is ...... for such drugs.<br><sup>そして、そんな薬物をヤミディレは……</sup><br><sup>And that kind of drug, Yamidile...</sup></p>
<p id="L174"><br></p>
<p id="L175">He said, "...... Earth went to help Yamidire with the people of ...... this country. They're not brainwashed or threatened, they're on their own."<br><sup>「……アースは……この国の人たちとヤミディレを助けに行ったそうだ。洗脳されているわけでも脅されているわけでもなく、自分の意思でだ」</sup><br><sup>"...Earth... went to help the people of this country and the Yamidile.I'm not brainwashed or threatened, but on my own initiative."</sup></p>
<p id="L176">"Yeah. And Sadis with me. I'm sure there's a reason for that. ......"<br><sup>「ええ。サディスも一緒に。何か理由はあるんだろうけど……」</sup><br><sup>"Yes. Sadis, too.I wonder if there's a reason..."</sup></p>
<p id="L177">"Yeah, it's ......, but it's ......."<br><sup>「ああ……だけど……」</sup><br><sup>"Oh... but..."</sup></p>
<p id="L178"><br></p>
<p id="L179">Yamidire is a dangerous man and now one of the world's highest bounty hunters.<br><sup>ヤミディレは危険人物として、今は世界最高額クラスの賞金首。</sup><br><sup>As a dangerous person, Yamidile is now the world's top prize winner.</sup></p>
<p id="L180">We'll secure it as soon as we find it. Dead or alive.<br><sup>見つけ次第即確保。生死問わずだ。</sup><br><sup>Secure it as soon as you find it.Life or death.</sup></p>
<p id="L181">No mercy is required. In fact, they were trying to cripple a young man with a future.<br><sup>容赦は不要だ。実際、未来ある若者を廃人に陥れようとしていた。</sup><br><sup>There is no need for forgiveness.In fact, he was trying to put a young man in ruins.</sup></p>
<p id="L182">No matter what the circumstances are there, we can't allow that to happen.<br><sup>そこにどんな事情があったとしても、それを許していいはずがない。</sup><br><sup>No matter what the circumstances may be, it cannot be forgiven.</sup></p>
<p id="L183">But neither Ma'am nor I had an easy answer as to what we should do.<br><sup>だけど、俺もマアムもどうすべきかの答えが簡単に出てこなかった。</sup><br><sup>But neither I nor Maam could easily answer what to do.</sup></p>
<p id="L184"><br></p>
<p id="L185">Because the more we listen, the more we realize that we don't know anything.<br><sup>何故なら、話を聞けば聞くほど、俺たちは何も分かっていないと思い知らされるからだ。</sup><br><sup>Because the more we listen, the more we realize that we don't understand anything.</sup></p>
<p id="L186"><br></p>
<p id="L187">We didn't know what we were doing, and that's why Earth was disappointed in us.<br><sup>そんな何も分かっていない俺たちだから、アースに失望されたんだ。</sup><br><sup>We didn't understand anything like that, so we were disappointed in Earth.</sup></p>
