<p id="L1">I was getting a headache because of Parisi, but ...... I honestly don't care about that anymore, now.<br><sup>パリピの所為で頭が痛くなっていたが……正直もうそのことに関して、今はどうでもよくなった。</sup><br><sup>I had a headache because of Paripi, but honestly, I don't care about it anymore.</sup></p>
<p id="L2"><br></p>
<p id="L3"><br></p>
<p id="L4">"Okay, I'm getting a good feeling about this. Brother, are we almost there?"<br><sup>「よーし、イイ感じになってきた。兄ちゃん、もうちょいだぞ？」</sup><br><sup>"All right, it's starting to look good.Big Brother, it's almost there."</sup></p>
<p id="L5"><br></p>
<p id="L6"><br></p>
<p id="L7">What the hell is ......?<br><sup>な……なんだこれは？</sup><br><sup>Well... what's this?</sup></p>
<p id="L8"><br></p>
<p id="L9">"Heck, I'll feed you all you want."<br><sup>「へへ、いくらでも食わせてやるよ」</sup><br><sup>"Hehe, I'll feed you as much as I want."</sup></p>
<p id="L10">"Fresh catches taste better, right?<br><sup>「獲れたての新鮮はうめーぞ？」</sup><br><sup>"You don't like fresh fish?"</sup></p>
<p id="L11">"You can't get this taste in the Empire.<br><sup>「帝国とかじゃ、この味は体験できねーだろうな」</sup><br><sup>"I don't think you can experience this taste in an empire."</sup></p>
<p id="L12"><br></p>
<p id="L13">The fish market, once full of fishermen and shoppers, was transformed at night, with stalls serving fresh fish and alcohol lining the streets.<br><sup>せわしなく漁港の漁師たちと、買い物客たちで溢れていた魚市場が夜になったら姿を変え、新鮮な魚と酒を振る舞う屋台が路上に立ち並んだ。</sup><br><sup>The fish market, which used to be crowded with fishermen and shoppers, changed its appearance at night and lined the streets with stalls serving fresh fish and alcohol.</sup></p>
<p id="L14">Instead of being in a building, we turned over a case or something that we used for work and used it as a table, and used a bucket or something like that as a chair, and kind of ...... or ...... well, that's fine.<br><sup>建物の中ではなく、作業に使ったケースとかをひっくり返してテーブル代わりに使い、バケツみたいなのを椅子代わりにして、なんというか……いや……まぁそれはいい。</sup><br><sup>It's not inside the building, it's inside out, it's inside out, it's inside out, it's inside out, it's inside out, it's inside out, it's inside out, it's inside out, it's inside out, it's inside out, it's inside out.</sup></p>
<p id="L15">The problem is ......<br><sup>問題なのは……</sup><br><sup>The problem is...</sup></p>
<p id="L16"><br></p>
<p id="L17">"These prawns are so good, you just boil them.<br><sup>「この、ゲンカーンエビはボイルするだけでウメーからよ」</sup><br><sup>"This shrimp is from the plum just by boiling it."</sup></p>
<p id="L18"><br></p>
<p id="L19">A whole large shrimp is placed in a pot of sizzling hot water that is being used in front of me.<br><sup>目の前で使い込まれた鍋の中に、大きめのエビが丸ごとグツグツと火の通ったお湯に入れられている。</sup><br><sup>In a pot used right in front of you, a whole large shrimp is placed in boiling water.</sup></p>
<p id="L20">Other shellfish and other fish were also thrown in with gusto.<br><sup>その他にも貝や他の魚も豪快にぶち込まれている。</sup><br><sup>Shellfish and other fish are also vigorously thrown in.</sup></p>
<p id="L21">How can you call this cooking?　It's so different from the kind of food Sadis always made for us.<br><sup>こんなの料理と言えるのか？　サディスがいつも作ってくれたような料理とは大違いだ。</sup><br><sup>Can you say this is a dish like this?It's very different from the kind of food Sadis always cooked for me.</sup></p>
<p id="L22">And yet ......<br><sup>なのに……</sup><br><sup>But...</sup></p>
<p id="L23"><br></p>
<p id="L24">"Gokri: ......"<br><sup>「ゴクリ……」</sup><br><sup>"Gurgling..."</sup></p>
<p id="L25"><br></p>
<p id="L26">Just by looking at it, it looks delicious. No, I can already tell it's good just by looking at it.<br><sup>見ただけで、ウマそうだ。いや、もう見ただけでウマいと分かる。</sup><br><sup>Just by looking at it, it looks like it's going to be a horse.No, I can tell it's good just by looking at it now.</sup></p>
<p id="L27">Then, deciding it was time, the old men handed me the boiled shrimp as it was.<br><sup>そして、頃合いだと判断して、ボイルされたエビを、おっさんたちはそのまま俺に手渡してきた。</sup><br><sup>Then, judging that it was the right time, the old men handed me the boiled shrimp.</sup></p>
<p id="L28"><br></p>
<p id="L29">"Here, break it open and cover it with your own hands!"<br><sup>「ほれ、そいつを割ってそのままかぶり付きな！」</sup><br><sup>"Come on, break it and just bite it!"</sup></p>
<p id="L30">"Oh, hey, guys. ...... What?　Is this it?"<br><sup>「あ、お、ども……え？　このまま？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</sup></p>
<p id="L31">"Oh, snap out of it!"<br><sup>「おう、パキッといけ！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, snap!"</sup></p>
<p id="L32"><br></p>
<p id="L33">It wasn't cut up in a way that made it easy to eat, and there was no fork or anything.<br><sup>食いやすいように切られているわけでもなければ、フォークとかもない。</sup><br><sup>It's not cut to make it easier to eat, nor is it a fork.</sup></p>
<p id="L34">And more: ......<br><sup>さらに……</sup><br><sup>What's more...</sup></p>
<p id="L35"><br></p>
<p id="L36">"What about that ...... lemon or ...... source?"<br><sup>「あの……レモンとか……ソースは？」</sup><br><sup>"Well... lemons... sauce?"</sup></p>
<p id="L37"><br></p>
<p id="L38">Isn't there anything to add flavor?　This is just boiling seafood in hot water, right?<br><sup>何か味を付けるものは無いのか？　これじゃ、ただ魚介類をお湯でボイルしただけだろ？</sup><br><sup>Is there anything to season?Then you just boiled the seafood in hot water, right?</sup></p>
<p id="L39">If you wonder about that, the old men will "chit-chat" with their fingers. ......<br><sup>そう疑問に思ったら、おっさんたちは指で「ちっちっち」と……</sup><br><sup>When I wondered, the old men said with their fingers, "Tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick."</sup></p>
<p id="L40"><br></p>
<p id="L41">"Just like that.<br><sup>「そのままだ」</sup><br><sup>"Still,"</sup></p>
<p id="L42">"What, what?"<br><sup>「え、え～？」</sup><br><sup>"What?"</sup></p>
<p id="L43"><br></p>
<p id="L44">I'd at least like some salt or garlic or something like that. ...... Isn't this not enough flavor?<br><sup>せめて塩とかガーリックとかそういうのが欲しいのに……これじゃ味が物足りないんじゃないのか？</sup><br><sup>At least I want salt, garlic, etc. Isn't this not enough?</sup></p>
<p id="L45">It looks so good, it would be great if it was seasoned a bit more. ...... Well, ...... I don't know what to do. ......<br><sup>せっかくこんな見た目もウマそうなんだから、あとちょっと味付けしてもらえれば最高なのに……まあ……仕方ねえか……</sup><br><sup>It would be great if you could season it a little more... well... I can't help it...</sup></p>
<p id="L46"><br></p>
<p id="L47">"Ach, ...... oh, oh!"<br><sup>「あちっ……うお、おお！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh... oh, oh!"</sup></p>
<p id="L48"><br></p>
<p id="L49">Feeling a little frustrated, I broke off the tail of the hot shrimp, and it crunched open, revealing a generous amount of meat ......Oh ......p, plump!<br><sup>ちょっと不満に感じながらも、熱々のエビの尻尾を折ると、パキッと音を立てて、たっぷりの身が……お、ォォ……ぷ、プリップリだ！</sup><br><sup>I felt a little dissatisfied, but when I broke the tail of the hot shrimp, it snapped and made a lot of meat... oh... oh... puff, crisp!</sup></p>
<p id="L50">What the heck is this?　It's full of body, and yet it's such a ......<br><sup>な、なんだこれ？　身がたっぷりで、それでいてこんな……</sup><br><sup>What's this?I'm full, but I'm like this...</sup></p>
<p id="L51"><br></p>
<p id="L52"><br></p>
<p id="L53">"Well, then, I'll take ...... ...... ah~...... m......?<br><sup>「じゃ、じゃあ……いただきます……あ～……む……ッッッ！！！？？？」</sup><br><sup>"Well, then... I'll have it... oh... uh... uh!!?"</sup></p>
<p id="L54"><br></p>
<p id="L55"><br></p>
<p id="L56">I took a bite out of my body, my heart pounding.<br><sup>俺は胸を高鳴らせながら、身を一口でかぶり付いた。</sup><br><sup>My heart fluttered and I bit myself in one bite.</sup></p>
<p id="L57">At that moment, the ...... "ocean" ...... itself spread in my mouth.<br><sup>その瞬間俺の口内には……「海」……そのものが広がった。</sup><br><sup>At that moment, in my mouth... "Sea" itself spread.</sup></p>
<p id="L58"><br></p>
<p id="L59">"Niiii!"<br><sup>「にぃ～」</sup><br><sup>"Nee~"</sup></p>
<p id="L60">"Hihihi, how's it going?"<br><sup>「ひひひひ、どうでい？」</sup><br><sup>"How are you, baboon?"</sup></p>
<p id="L61">kanji "heptad" radical at left<br><sup>「へへん」</sup><br><sup>"Hehe,"</sup></p>
<p id="L62"><br></p>
<p id="L63">All the old guys are looking at me with a smug "How's it going?<br><sup>おっさんたちが全員「どうだ」とドヤ顔で俺を見ている。</sup><br><sup>All the old men are looking at me like, "What do you think?"</sup></p>
<p id="L64">No, I don't care how or what ...... seasoning?　I don't want any. What?　What's this?<br><sup>いや、どうだも何も……味付け？　なんもいらねえ。は？　なにこれ？</sup><br><sup>No, I don't care... Seasoning?I don't need anything. Huh? What's this?</sup></p>
<p id="L65"><br></p>
<p id="L66">For me, the best food in the world is the food Sadis makes.<br><sup>俺にとって世界一ウマい料理はサディスの作った料理だ。</sup><br><sup>The best dish in the world for me is Sadis's.</sup></p>
<p id="L67"><br></p>
<p id="L68">But this food is ...... the best ...... I've ever had in my life.<br><sup>でも、この食材は……俺のこれまでの人生で一番……</sup><br><sup>But this ingredient... is the best in my life...</sup></p>
<p id="L69"><br></p>
<p id="L70"><br></p>
<p id="L71">"Come on, big brother!　Go, go, go!"<br><sup>「ほら、兄ちゃん！　どんどんいけ！」</sup><br><sup>"Look, brother! Keep going!"</sup></p>
<p id="L72"><br></p>
<p id="L73">"These clams don't need any seasoning either. They're salted!"<br><sup>「こっちの貝も何も味付けいらねぇ。塩ふいてるからよぉ！」</sup><br><sup>"I don't need any seasoning for this shellfish, either.It's because I'm wiping salt!"</sup></p>
<p id="L74"><br></p>
<p id="L75">"Come on, let's have a drink, let's have a drink.　Here's to a promising fisherman!"<br><sup>「おっしゃ、酒もいこうぜ酒も！　将来有望な漁師に乾杯よぉ！」</sup><br><sup>"Say, let's drink and drink! Cheers to promising fishermen!"</sup></p>
<p id="L76"><br></p>
<p id="L77">「「「「 oooh oooh oooh ！！！！」」」」<br><sup>「「「「オオオオオォォォォォォ！！！！」」」」</sup><br><sup>"""Oh my gosh!"""</sup></p>
<p id="L78"><br></p>
<p id="L79"><br></p>
<p id="L80">I noticed that the old men eating at the other tables around me were also shouting with bottles of alcohol.<br><sup>気付けば、周りの他のテーブルで飯食ってるおっさんたちも酒瓶もって声を上げていた。</sup><br><sup>I found that the old men eating at the other tables around me were holding bottles of sake.</sup></p>
<p id="L81"><br></p>
<p id="L82">"Well, it looks like you've finally experienced the true joy of travel, child.<br><sup>『ふふふ、ようやく旅の醍醐味というものを味わえたようだな、童よ』</sup><br><sup>"Hmm, you seem to have finally tasted the real pleasure of traveling, child,"</sup></p>
<p id="L83">"Traina?　Oh, no, it's just me. ......<br><sup>『トレイナ？　あっ、わり、なんか俺だけ……』</sup><br><sup>"Trainer? Oh, I'm the only one..."</sup></p>
<p id="L84">"All you have to do is materialize it later in the world of Vuir. That way I can share my taste buds with you!　Well, I'll remember this even if you don't. ......<br><sup>『あとでヴイアールの世界で具現化してくれさえすればいい。それで余も味覚を共有できるのでな！　ま、してもらわずともコレに関しては余も覚えているがな……』</sup><br><sup>'All you have to do is embody it later in the world of Vial.That's why we can share our taste buds!Well, I remember this much even if you don't..."</sup></p>
<p id="L85"><br></p>
<p id="L86">It's been three months since I left the Empire. But in Cakretail, where I spent most of that time, Sadis had been cooking for me for some reason.<br><sup>帝国から出て三カ月。といってもそのほとんどを過ごしたカクレテールではなんだかんだでサディスが料理してくれてた。</sup><br><sup>Three months after leaving the empire, Sadis cooked for me in Kakretail, where I spent most of my time.</sup></p>
<p id="L87">Well, that was also an island country surrounded by the sea, so the fish and other things were good, but they were cooked.<br><sup>まぁ、あそこも海に囲まれていた島国だったから、魚とかもうまかったけど、調理されていたものだった。</sup><br><sup>Well, it was also an island country surrounded by the sea, so fish were delicious, but they used to be cooked.</sup></p>
<p id="L88">That's why I didn't think I could eat something that was just a little boiled like this and be impressed by it.<br><sup>だからこそ、こんな風にちょっとボイルしただけのものを食って、それで感動するなんて思わなかった。</sup><br><sup>That's why I didn't expect to be moved by eating just a little boiled food like this.</sup></p>
<p id="L89"><br></p>
<p id="L90">"The seafood caught in the seas around the Abosore continent is delicious. I can attest to that.<br><sup>『アボソア大陸近海の海で獲れる魚介類はウマい。余もそれは認めている』</sup><br><sup>"The seafood caught in the seas off the continent of Avosoa is horsey.I admit it.'</sup></p>
<p id="L91">"Huh. ......<br><sup>『へぇ～……』</sup><br><sup>'Oh...'</sup></p>
<p id="L92">And the sake. I think he was trying to make a sake that would go well with fish. ...... Well, you're not ready yet.<br><sup>『あと酒もな。魚と合う酒を造ろうとしたのだろうな……まぁ、貴様にはまだ早いがな』</sup><br><sup>"And alcohol.You must have tried to make sake that goes well with fish......well, it's too early for you.'</sup></p>
<p id="L93"><br></p>
<p id="L94">I see. That's quite a feat, even Toraina would agree.<br><sup>なるほど。トレイナも認めるってことは、そりゃ相当なもんだ。</sup><br><sup>I see. It's reasonable that Trina admits it.</sup></p>
<p id="L95">I used to think that the DiPercha Empire was the center of the world, and therefore everything, industry and food culture, was the best in the world.<br><sup>俺は今まで「ディパーチャ帝国こそが世界の中心」だと思い、そのためあらゆるもの、産業においても食の文化においても、全てが世界一だと思っていた。</sup><br><sup>I used to think that the "departure empire" was the center of the world, so I thought everything was the best in everything, in industry and in food culture.</sup></p>
<p id="L96">But that's hubris, or maybe I simply didn't know anything about it.<br><sup>でも、それは思い上がりというか、単純に俺が何も知らなかっただけだ。</sup><br><sup>But it was presumptuous, or simply I didn't know anything.</sup></p>
<p id="L97">Just a few days traveling by boat and you'll find this ......<br><sup>ちょっと船で数日移動しただけで、こんな……</sup><br><sup>I just traveled a few days by boat, and it was like this...</sup></p>
<p id="L98"><br></p>
<p id="L99"><br></p>
<p id="L100">"That's right, child. To know the world is not only to fight and win against the strong enemies of the land. It is also important to expand your own world by experiencing the local culture.<br><sup>『その通りだ、童。世界を知るというのは、その土地土地の強敵と戦って勝つことだけではない。その土地の文化に触れることで、己の世界を広げることも重要なのだ』</sup><br><sup>"That's right, young man.Knowing the world is not just about fighting and winning against the strong enemies of the land.It's also important to expand your world by being exposed to the local culture."</sup></p>
<p id="L101"><br></p>
<p id="L102">"Traina: ......<br><sup>『トレイナ……』</sup><br><sup>"Trainer..."</sup></p>
<p id="L103"><br></p>
<p id="L104">"As I may have said before, the world you live in is not the whole world. It is only when you acknowledge the existence of worlds other than your own that your world expands.<br><sup>『以前も言ったかもしれぬが、自分の住む世界が世界の全てではない。自分以外の世界の存在を認めてこそ、初めて世界が広がる』</sup><br><sup>"As I may have said before, the world I live in is not everything in the world.Only when you acknowledge the existence of a world other than yourself can the world expand."</sup></p>
<p id="L105"><br></p>
<p id="L106">"...... Oshinobu.<br><sup>『……押忍』</sup><br><sup>"...pressing patience,"</sup></p>
<p id="L107"><br></p>
<p id="L108">I'm not sure what to do, but I'm sure it's a good idea. It's a story that will make your meal go bad. I'm not sure what to say.<br><sup>『ふっ……まぁ、余が言ってもな……それができなかったからこそ、人間も魔族も何百年間もずっと……いやよい。メシがマズくなる話だ。さっさと食え』</sup><br><sup>'Well... well, if I may say so... because I couldn't do it, men and demons have been doing it for hundreds of years... no, it's okay.It's a story that makes the rice worse.Hurry up and eat.'</sup></p>
<p id="L109"><br></p>
<p id="L110"><br></p>
<p id="L111">Traina tells me with a bit of a sobering look.<br><sup>ちょっとしんみりとした様子で俺に教えてくれるトレイナ。</sup><br><sup>Trina, who teaches me in a quiet manner.</sup></p>
<p id="L112">I think we talked about that around Hong Ybor, didn't we?<br><sup>たしか、ホンイーボあたりでそんな話をしたっけな？</sup><br><sup>If I remember correctly, did we talk about that around Hong Ebo?</sup></p>
<p id="L113">Come to think of it, it's been a long time since Traina taught me anything other than fighting like this, since all I did was train all the time when I was in Kakuretail.<br><sup>そういえば、カクレテールに居た頃はずっとトレーニングばかりしていたから、こうやってトレイナが戦い以外のことを教えてくれるのも久しぶりだな。</sup><br><sup>Come to think of it, it's been a long time since Trina taught me anything other than fighting because I trained all the time when I was in Cacletail.</sup></p>
<p id="L114"><br></p>
<p id="L115">"Hey, bro, here's another one!　Eat more!"<br><sup>「おら、兄ちゃん、これもだ！　わけーんだから、もっと食え！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, brother, this one, too! OK, so eat more!"</sup></p>
<p id="L116">"Hey, bro, how about a sip of alcohol?　It's okay if it's just a sip, right?　Atmosphere, atmosphere!<br><sup>「兄ちゃん、酒を一口ぐらいいっとくか？　な～に、一口だけなら大丈夫だろ？　雰囲気だ雰囲気！」</sup><br><sup>"Brother, do you want a sip of alcohol?"It's okay if it's just a bite, right?It's the atmosphere!"</sup></p>
<p id="L117">"Come on, come on, come on!"<br><sup>「ほれ、ほれほーれ！」</sup><br><sup>"I love you, I love you!"</sup></p>
<p id="L118">"Oh, okay, so my brother ran away from the empire?"<br><sup>「あ～、そうかい、兄ちゃんは帝国を家出してきたのか？」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, I see, did you run away from the empire?"</sup></p>
<p id="L119">"That's how I got my first ride as an apprentice on my dad's boat as a fisherman.<br><sup>「１５？　いいね～、俺も漁師だった親父の船に、見習いとして初めて乗せてもらったのもそれぐらいだぜ」</sup><br><sup>"15? Good~ That's about the first time I got on my father's boat as an apprentice."</sup></p>
<p id="L120">"I've never seen anyone who can carry that much weight at once. I've never seen anyone who can carry that much weight at once.<br><sup>「しっかし、兄ちゃんはスゲーパワーを持ってるんだな。あんだけ重ぇもんをいっぺんに持てる奴はぁ見たことねえ」</sup><br><sup>"Well, my brother has great power.I've never seen anyone with so much weight at once."</sup></p>
<p id="L121">"If you keep working like this, you'll be a rising star with a promising future!"<br><sup>「このまま働いてくれりゃぁ、将来有望な期待の新星だぜ！」</sup><br><sup>"If you keep working like this, you'll be a promising novice!"</sup></p>
<p id="L122">"Whoa, let's sing!"<br><sup>「おっしゃ、歌うぞ！」</sup><br><sup>"Say, I'll sing!"</sup></p>
<p id="L123">"Bring me my drink!　Here's a drinking glass for you, brother.<br><sup>「酒持ってこーい！　おら、兄ちゃんにも酒用のグラスだグラス！」</sup><br><sup>"Bring me a drink!"Oh, it's a glass for my brother, too!"</sup></p>
<p id="L124">"Oh, well, I'll teach you how to drink!"<br><sup>「おーし、こうなったら、俺が酒の飲み方を教えてやる！」</sup><br><sup>"Oh, if this happens, I'll teach you how to drink!"</sup></p>
<p id="L125">"You know what?　Some young people who don't know how to drink alcohol mistakenly think it's cool to drink it all at once, but that's an insult to alcohol!<br><sup>「いいか～？　酒の飲み方を知らない若造は、なんかこ～、一気に飲むのがカッコいいとか勘違いしてるバカがいるがよ～、そんなの酒への冒涜だ！」</sup><br><sup>"Look~? Some young people who don't know how to drink are mistaken for being cool to drink all at once~ That's an insult to alcohol!"</sup></p>
<p id="L126">"I'm not sure what to say. Enjoy it from the aroma first. ...... Yeah, it prepares your organs and your mind for the fact that your body is going to be filled with alcohol now.<br><sup>「そうそう。まずは香りから楽しむ……うん、今から体に酒が入るんだぞと、内臓や心に準備をさせる」</sup><br><sup>"Right. Enjoy the scent first... Yeah, I'm going to get alcohol in my body now, and I'm going to get my internal organs and mind ready."</sup></p>
<p id="L127">"Just a little bit of a lick first.<br><sup>「まずは少しチビリと舐めるぐらいの量を」</sup><br><sup>"First of all, give me a little lick."</sup></p>
<p id="L128">"And next, this snack will give you a little thirst."<br><sup>「そして、次はこのつまみでちょっと渇きを与える」</sup><br><sup>"And next time, I'll give you a little thirst with this knob."</sup></p>
<p id="L129">"So, chivvy ...... chivvy ...... again."<br><sup>「で、またチビリ……チビリ……」</sup><br><sup>"And then again, tingling... tingling..."</sup></p>
<p id="L130"><br></p>
<p id="L131">But the old men are already done, or maybe they're already red-faced and fussing.<br><sup>にしても、おっさんたちは既にできあがってるのか、もう顔を真っ赤にして大騒ぎだ。</sup><br><sup>Even so, perhaps the old men are already done, and they are already making a fuss with their faces are red.</sup></p>
<p id="L132">Even though I was supposed to be the guest of honor, he got excited and even offered me a drink.<br><sup>俺が主賓なはずなのに、なんかもう勝手に盛り上がっては、俺に酒まで勧めてくる。</sup><br><sup>I'm supposed to be the guest of honor, but I'm already excited and even recommended me a drink.</sup></p>
